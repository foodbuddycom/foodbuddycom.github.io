        <p>2 portions of vegetables and 1 portion of grains (buckwheat) will give you as many calories as ~ 200 g of beef steak (~700 Cal) ☝🏼️ BUT with 10X ⬇️ fat, 20X ⬆️ dietary fiber (which is so good for our health: lowers cholesterol level, controls blood sugar level, controls weight) and 50% ⬇️ protein (which can be sourced through other foods).
