        <p>Good tropical lazy Sunday morning! 🌴☀️ dragon fruit, kiwis, passion fruits (add a pinch of salt to passion fruit - helps to reduce its bitterness) + super food bowls: soaked chia and rolled oats topped with almonds, walnuts and Brazil nuts🇧🇷 (slightly roasted on pan without any oil). Brazil nuts are a great source of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (palmitoleic acid 16:1 and oleic acid 18:1) that help to reduce the level of "bad cholesterol" and increase level of "good cholesterol". Brazil nuts have an exceptionally high level of selenium (3-4 nuts per day is enough to get daily norm of selenium) that is so important cofactor for anti-oxidant enzymes, our immunity, and metabolism. They are also very rich in protein, B-complex group of vitamins and such minerals as copper, magnesium, manganese which support our metabolism, strengthen our bones and help to fight free radicals. Brazil nuts, like Almonds, are gluten free 👍🏼</p>
