        <p>Can you imagine that this huge plate with 2 zucchini, 2 leak, long beans is just 311 kCal?! There's no way you'll be hungry after eating it because of high water and fiber content 😁 and recipe is so simple: you will need 2 frying pans/wok, a bit of olive oil, cut zucchini, leak and long beans into 1 -2 inch slices, stir fry them lightly, add salt, peoper, ground garlic and kale leaves - ENJOY! Don't forget to track your food with FoodBuddy app (link in bio ☝🏼) know what's on your plate 👍🏼
