        <p>Would you like this bowl of goodness 😊👌🏼mung beans, avocado 🥑 and stir fried broccoli 🥦 cauliflower, baby corn 🌽 shimeji mushrooms and carrots 🥕  very delicious with cayenne pepper 🔥
We LOVE mung beans! They are very delicious and this is a great source of plant-based protein (very rich in essential amino acids that our bodies can’t produce). Besides protein, mung beans are rich in antioxidants and many minerals and vitamins. They can be also consumed sprouted which we’ve never tried before and very curious to eat them in sprouts. Apparently, sprouted mung beans contain fewer calories but have more antioxidants and amino acids ☝🏼 have you guys tried sprouted mung beans? —
