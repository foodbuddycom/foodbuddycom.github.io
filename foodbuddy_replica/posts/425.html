        <p>Bake fish instead of frying it. Blanch broccoli and French beans instead of boiling them to get the most nutrients out of your meal. The results of Cardiovascular Health Study among 5,073 older adults showed that “the intake of tuna or other broiled or baked fish was associated with improved cardiac hemodynamics, but fried fish intake was associated with structural abnormalities indicative of systolic dysfunction and potential coronary atherosclerosis. These findings suggest potential specific physiologic mechanisms that may, in part, account for the effects of fish intake on cardiovascular health” - the American Journal of Cardiology. 
As for broccoli and French beans - they don’t lose their precious antioxidants when blanched. You will get an opposite result if you boil them.
