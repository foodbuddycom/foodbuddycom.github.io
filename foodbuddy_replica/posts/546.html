        <p>This type of dinner/lunch not only super fast but very healthy. All you need to prepare:1 sauce pan with boiling water, 1 fryinng pan, veggies and soba.
Cut asparagus,couliflower and broccoli and steam over boiling water for 5 min. If you don't have steam pot you can simply blanch veggies for 3-5 min in boiled water. Remove vegetbles and add soba nuddles into the same water,add some salt and pepper to your taste. In 3-5 min Soba will be ready. In the meanwhile slice mushrooms and grill them without oil on the pan covered with lid until the moist evaporates. Mix soba with mushrooms. Soba - buckwheat noodles - very good for your blood sugar level, also it has high content of fiber, so you will feel full for longer period of time, it's gluten free and rich in protein, manganese, thiamine. Lightly steamed couliflower, brocolli and asparagus are super delicious - soft yet crunchy and remain all valuable vitamins and minerals, great source of antioxidants. Eat and stay healthy!ðŸ’ª
