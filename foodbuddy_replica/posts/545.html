        <p>Rolling towards working week with a healthy snack 👍🏼🌯 snacking is the trickiest part of our diet: it's so little that seems it can't do any major harm to our nutrition and performance, right? Well, a little goes a long way... and it can be revealed with the help of Respiratore Exchange Rate (RER) measurements that @coached.fitness does in Singapore 😉! RER shows what kind of fuel an athlete burns at a given treadmill load by mathematical comparison of CO2 exhaled.
