        <p>CHICKPEAS AND FETA SHAKSHUKA 🤤: 
I don’t think we will go back to plain fried eggs 🍳😄after this shakshuka. Inspired by shakshuka that we tired during our last weekend visit to @fennelcafe 
So easy to cook and so delicious! 
Our cast iron pan is small, so amount of ingredients can be adjusted but this is what we used: 
➖ 1 tbsp olive oil
➖1/2 red onion (can be yellow, we just didn’t have one 😜) thinly sliced 
➖ 1/4 red bell pepper thinly sliced 
➖1 garlic clove thinly sliced 
➖ 1 tsp paprika 
➖ 1/2 tsp ground cumin 
➖ 1/4 chilli powder 
➖ 3 tbsp cooked chickpeas (canned) 
➖ 1/2 tomato 🍅 chopped 
➖ 3/4 cup tomato purée (can add more to your taste)
➖ 4 eggs 🥚 
➖ 2 slices feta cheese 
➖ fresh parsley 

COOKING METHOD: 
1️⃣ pour oil on heated pan, add onion and bell pepper, stir fry for few min until onion is golden
2️⃣ add garlic, chickpeas and spices. Stir fry for few more min 
3️⃣ add tomatoes and tomato purée, mix well 
4️⃣ make small holes for eggs, then crack an egg into each hole. 
5️⃣ break feta slices into small chunks and add to shakshuka. Cook 3-5 min until eggs are semi-cooked 
6️⃣ sprinkle shakshuka with parsley and enjoy!
