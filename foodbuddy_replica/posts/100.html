        <p>When morning starts with a smoothie bowl and toasted homemade bread it feels like you are on vacation ☺️🌴☀️ just turn on sea wave sounds and enjoy your yummy breakfast by the “sea” 😄 luckily these days most of us don’t have to rush to work as it’s right here, on the same table next to your breakfast, just connect to VPN and go back to reality... where do you find your moments of zen while working from home? 🤔
