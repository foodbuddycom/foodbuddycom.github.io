        <p>Found a nice recipe for my recovery meal on Instagram and modified it a bit - instead of using only oranges, I used oranges and lemons (I didn't have enough oranges 😁) and I didn't regret a second! It was a wonderful mix of flavors: not too sweet (I guess it would be so if I had only oranges),very fresh and juicy. Chicken is covered with mix of 1 tsp of paprika, 1tbsp of honey, 2 tbsp of soy sauce, salt and pepper to your taste! Bake for 1 hr. Very easy but keep an eye on your bird, cover it with juice frequently if you want it to be less brownish than mine 😄(it was very delicious though, not burnt at all)  #iromantri #triathlon #marathon #healthyfood #sportnutrition #swimbikerun #dietfood #orbea #cervelo #specializedbikes #giantbikes #canyonbikes #bmcbikes #ironmantraining #marathontraining #trailrun  #recovery #chicken #leanmeat #homemadefood #homemade #foodsg</p>
