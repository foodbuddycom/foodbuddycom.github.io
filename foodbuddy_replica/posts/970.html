        <p>Yes to this coffee!!! ☕️👍🏼 Interesting fact ☝🏼️According to research published in 2008 in the Journal Of Applied Physiology, a cup of coffee and sweet potato can be a better recovery meal 🤔
That research found that athletes who ingested coffee after exercise had approximately 66 % more muscle glycogen than those who ingested a placebo four hours after exercise. 66 % more fuel can help you go farther and faster for the next day's training or competition 🏊🏼🚴🏻🏃🏼💪🏼</p>
