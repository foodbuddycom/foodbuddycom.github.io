        <p>Have noodle cravings 🍜? Go for Japanese soba - buckwheat noodle it is the best noodle for your weight control 👍🏼interesting fact: The most famous Japanese soba noodles come from Nagano. Soba from Nagano is called Shinano Soba or Shinshu soba. The tradition of eating soba originates from the Tokugawa period, also called the Edo period, from 1603 to 1868. In the Tokugawa era, every neighborhood had one or two soba establishments, many also serving sake, which functioned much like modern cafes where locals would stop for a casual meal ☝🏼</p>
