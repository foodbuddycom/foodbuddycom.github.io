        <p>What do you prefer: blended or cut fruits and berries with seeds and yogurt? 🤔 I like smoothie however cut fruits with seeds and yogurt increases my satiety. In fact, when you cut fruits you don't destroy insoluble fiber which is good for your blood sugar control. On the other hand, blending fruits fruits can make certain nutrients more absorbable. Looks like rotation of these 2 options is the best choice! 👍🏼
