        <p>Great breakfast before your race start or long stressful day at work that can also test your endurance. Oatmeal porridge cooked with water and 0% fat milk, small slice of butter, frozen acai berry juice (it’s so yummy when it melts in hot porridge 😋), mango (I had Indian mango - super sweet and juicy) and blueberries 💪🏼 this is a power meal! Oatmeal porridge and fruits are great source of slow carbs (low GI) the energy that they provide lasts longer and it will keep you going without snacks for quite some time.
