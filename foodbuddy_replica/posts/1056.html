        <p>I love to have onion in my meals, yes, it might smell awkward 😖 but, in my opinion, it gives a great taste to any meal😋. An interesting fact🤓, onions contain over 100 sulfide-containing compounds. These lead to a number of health benefits such as prevention of asthma and some types of cancer. Onions are similar to garlic, chives, and scallions. While they don’t all have the same level of health impact 👊🏼, they all have similar health benefits👍🏼 so don't be afraid of them 😉</p>
