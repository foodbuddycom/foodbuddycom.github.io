        <p>Powerful post-workout snack - bowl of raspberries 👍🏼"Phytochemicals in raspberries, which give them their ruby colour, guards against exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) after a strenuous session and speeds up recovery". You don't have to eat a bowl of raspberries, a handful of them after your training session is enough to  kick off recovery as they are packed with anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants that immediately start to reduce this damage. Hey @hollylawrencetri what's your favorite post-workout snack? 😉
