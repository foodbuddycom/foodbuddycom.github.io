        <p>Light lunch or dinner idea for you: barley with stir-fried broccolini, mushrooms, leek, ginger, onion and soya sauce! The carbs that you should really eat to stay healthy and fit! 💪🏼
We LOVE barley. It’s often overlooked but it’s an amazing grain that is good for your health, easy to cook and quite versatile - goes well with pretty much any dish! 👌🏼What’s your favourite dish with barley?
