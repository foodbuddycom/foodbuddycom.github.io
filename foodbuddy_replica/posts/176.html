        <p>Hey guys! Who’s doing what in 2020? At which sport events can we meet in-person? 🏊🏼‍♂️🚴🏼‍♂️🏃🏽‍♂️ I’m committed to two A-races this year, one is @ironmantri in Cairns (Queensland, Australia), voted one of the best courses in the world, and another one a Surf Coast Century ultra (Victoria, Australia). You can see how great race organization and experience attracts amateur athletes from around the world to Australia! Aussies, you rock! 🤟🏼 In-between, I’d have to play by ear on the B-races, as I want to both support our mentees well, and also figure our business trips schedule in a lean way so I don’t compromise my A-events.
