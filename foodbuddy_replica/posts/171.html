        <p>Good morning! Who is celebrating lunar new year 🧧? How are you celebrating? Singapore is “dead” for next few days - everything is closed and everyone is visiting family and friends. We’ve started a year of rat 🐀 (or mouse 🐭)with round the island ride 🚴🏼‍♂️ and these yummy oatmeal chocolate waffles for breakfast 🧇👌🏼! They are super easy to make: 
1. Ground rolled outs into flour (1-1.5 cup) 
2. 2 tbsp of cocoa powder (we used 100% cocoa, unsweetened) 
3. 1 tbsp of brown sugar 
4. 1 egg 
5. 2 tea spoons of baking powder
6. 1 tea spoon of ground cinnamon
7. 1/4 tea spoon of salt 
8. Water or milk 1.5 cup (and have some extra you may need to add) 
9. Mix everything to make batter
10. Make waffles in your waffle iron ENJOY 😉 —
