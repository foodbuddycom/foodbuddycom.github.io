        <p>Hey 👋🏻 athletes in Singapore 🇸🇬, check out the Oakley (and not only!..) polarised sport sunglasses restore craftsmen at Clear Lens Specialist.
😎👍🏼
I know we can all afford new sunglasses and yes, I know that restoration is not for every taste but hey... I genuinely admire those people who perfect their small niche tiny business to perfection, — and I’m really encouraging you to find such businesses and to trust them! 
They ain’t got Instagram, only Facebook “OakleyLensRestoration” or phone 📞 8203 8553

You know how much I love my bar-less @oakley EVZERO. They are perfect in aero bars, in the drops, under visor, — just about every cool event I do I use them. 
Apparently, after thousands and thousands of miles odo and treating them like an idiot with soapy water 🤦🏼‍♂️ (WRONG!!! Don’t do that!!!) and tissues at petrol stations 😬 (where we stop for liquid top-ups), I’ve managed to degrade them so badly I could not see through them. The hydrophobic layer that EVZERO has was gone, sweat and rain drops stayed on. I was desperate and then... and then one of our @team_integratedriding kakis recommended the Clear Lens Specialist.

They took good care of clearing my favourite Oakley lens vision COMPLETELY. With way better vision I can again have better focus on my running, cycling or... well, no, EVZERO-s aren’t really causal, but maybe your sunnies are, so also fishing, chilling, lepak-ing and towkay-ing 😄 definitely save this contact!
