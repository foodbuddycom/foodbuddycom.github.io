        <p>Indonesian cuisine is very delicious 😋 and has good variety of healthy options 👍🏼 - stir fried mixed veggies🍅🍆🌽 and greens🍃 with herbs and spices (Chilli is a great immune booster and source of potassium), tempeh - whole soybean cake (high in protein, dietary fiber and vitamins) and delicious beef or chicken rendang (well... it's definitely less healthy as the meat is fried so make sure it's not more than 20% of your daily diet 😉) if you have a chance to try Indonesian food - don't miss it!</p>
