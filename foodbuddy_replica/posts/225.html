        <p>How was your weekend guys? We had quite eventful, delicious and colourful one as you can see 😁 besides meeting with friends over bbq, we baked a tower of very healthy waffles which you should definitely try to make yourself. Here’s the recipe: 2 cups of mixed grains (we ground in blender a mixed grain porridge - a leftover after Ironman Cairns 😊), 2 eggs, 2 bananas, 2 cups of milk, 1 tbsp of whole meal flour, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, handful of walnuts (ground in blender), 1 tbsp of honey and 100% cocoa if you want a chocolate flavour 👌🏼 —
