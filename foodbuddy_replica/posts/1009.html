        <p>My thoughts and prayers are with my friends, followers and people of Belgium. About a year ago this was my routine morning 10 K loop next to Royal Family Palace. Today's tragedy deeply touched my feelings. Stay strong, fight back the terror, make future bright. Athletes of the world are with you, Belgium! 🇧🇪🙏🏼❤️</p>
