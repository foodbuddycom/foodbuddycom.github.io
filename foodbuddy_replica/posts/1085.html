        <p>In case you wondered how caffeine fasting week looks like - it looks HORRIBLE 😞😩😖 You wake up in the morning ⏰ and see a basset hound in the mirror who is only allowed to SMELL the coffee ☕️ not drink it 😱 
For us, caffeine fasting is the toughest part of tapering week but very useful ☝🏼️8 days of caffeine fasting will clean your body from accumulated caffeine and bring the level of adenosine back to normal and THEN!!! ⌛️
A cup of double espresso (3x better!) taken couple of hours before your race will make a super-duper magic ✨ 👻 💪🏼 and unbelievable boost of energy 🏃🏼🏃🏼🏃🏼
But make sure you take a coffee at least 2 hours before the race, otherwise 💩 you might find yourself on a potty instead of a start line 🙈</p>
