        <p>Oh YEAH! CHIA PUDDING!!! 😋 with kiwi, passion fruit, apples pear and blueberries and honey 🍯 🤤🥝🍎🍐 anyone could say no? 🤔 we love chia and eat it almost every day for breakfast, usually add 1-2 tbsp to oatmeal porridge. It is amazing how these tiny seeds can be such a powerful source 👊🏼of soooo many nutrients with just few calories (137 per 1 ounce)!!! No doubt it is one of the most nutritious foods on the planet, loaded with fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids and various micronutrients 💪🏼. Add chia to your diet if you haven’t done so yet.
