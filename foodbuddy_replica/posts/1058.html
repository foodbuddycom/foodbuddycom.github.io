        <p>It is such a rainy day today in Singapore ⛈⛈⛈but after the rain there's always a rainbow 😉 I haven't seen one in the Sky but made my own for Sunday dinner 👍🏼🌈 

Always try to "chase a rainbow" in your meals with the help of veggies and fruits 🍅🍊🍌🍏🍇🍆. This hearty soup is a good option - just make a chicken or beef broth, add chopped veggies (try to add as many colours as it's possible) and cook on a small heat 5-7 min (veggies should be semi-cooked at the end) Let the soup stay for a while. Enjoy your dinner! 🤗</p>
