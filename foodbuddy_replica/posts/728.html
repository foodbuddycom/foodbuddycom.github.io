        <p>Traditional Scandinavian dish - salmon soup (Lohikeitto) - easy to cook and very delicious. This was done according to recipe from the Endurance Diet book by Matt Fitzgerald: cook chopped leek and onion in a saucepan until they are soft, add 1 chopped carrot and 8 chopped potatoes (don't peel, it's more delicious), 2 cups of vegetable stock and 2 cups of water. Cook until potatoes are tender (~5 min). Turn heat to low an add 12 oz of fresh salmon (skinned and cut into cubes) and 4 oz of smoked salmon (cut into sliced) summer for 5 min. At the end add salt, pepper and milk (I used skimmed). Serve to plates. It will be extremely delicious with rye bread ðŸ˜‹ðŸ¤¤ #triathlon #ironmantri #healthyfood  #sportnutrition #running #swimbikerun #marathon #dietfood #cervelo #orbea #specializedbikes #giantbikes #canyonbikes #bmcbikes #boardmanbikes #trailrunning #ironmantraining #marathontraining</p>
