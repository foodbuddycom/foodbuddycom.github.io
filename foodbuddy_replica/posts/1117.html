        <p>Here's an open-water nutrition tip: iron! Iron is an important performance-related mineral☝🏼️, lack of which can reduce aerobic capacity and impair endurance performance😓. Ferritin - a protein that stores and manages iron release - is desirable in the 25-35 mg/L range. It's important to go from deficient to sufficient level of iron only (which is 17.5 mg/day for male and 23 mg/day for female swimmers). Gladly there's a wide range of delicious foods rich in iron. Here they are, sorted by quality categories (highest to lowest): dark green leafy veggies - spinach 🌿 is the king! Dried fruits - raisin and apricot. Peas, whole grains, seafood, poultry, red meat, pork.  Enjoy your food🍲 and swim🏊🏼. (photo by Ryan Pierse / Getty, 6.2mi swim in Hyde Park in 2012)</p>
