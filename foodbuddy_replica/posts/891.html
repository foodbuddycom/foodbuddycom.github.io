        <p>For all weekend warriors who religiously follow their training plans moulding themselves to improve their performance📈, remember to refuel your engines with high quality recovery foods after weekend long swims, rides or runs 🏊🏽🚴🏼🏃! The most important nutrients for immediate recovery are: carbs - to replenish glycogen stores, protein - to repair muscles (combination of carbs with protein stimulates the release of insulin, hence muscles repair, and glycogen) water - to rehydrate, and antioxidants - to limit muscles damage from leaking of free radicals and by the body's anti-inflammatory response 💪🏼😊</p>
