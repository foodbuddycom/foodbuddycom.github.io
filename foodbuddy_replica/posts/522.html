        <p>This is one of the most delicious recovery meals that you can make for yourself or for your partner: boiled tricolor quinoa, pan-fried (without oil) squid and juicy salad: fresh peas, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell-peppers, grapefruit, sunflower seeds. Looks complex? Not really, easily can be done in 10-15 min (if cook all three components in parallel üòâ) and you'll get so much needed protein to rebuild your muscles and healthy carbs to replenish your glycogen stores, not to mention all micronutrients that are in abundance on this plate. Don't be lazy, cook yourself a healthy meal ‚ò∫üëç #iromantri #triathlon #marathon #healthyfood #sportnutrition #swimbikerun #dietfood #orbea #cervelo #specializedbikes #giantbikes #canyonbikes #bmcbikes #boardmanbikes #ironmantraining #marathontraining #trailrun #powerfood #recovery</p>
