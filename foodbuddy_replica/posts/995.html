        <p>Chicken breast, mix salad leaves, asparagus, carrot and pomegranate seeds seasoned with olive oil and lemon juice - Super delicious but these carrots in the dish were something special 👌🏼 they were cooked yet crunchy with thyme and oil ☺️ - definitely a must try! 😋 I bet you remember that carrots are rich in beta carotene (helps prevent macular degeneration) which is a fat soluble compound and in order to maximise the value you'd better add healthy fats or oil 👍🏼</p>
