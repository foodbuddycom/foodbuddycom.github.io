        <p>Here's an idea of a great post-workout meal 🙃: Turkey breast 🦃 (skinless): probably the best source of protein 👌🏼 (much better than eggs or white tuna) ~35 g of protein with less than 1 g of total fat 💪🏼 ➕ high level of vitamin B complex and other minerals 
Mashed potatoes - rich source of carbs ~37 g, potassium - 13% of recommended daily intake, and vitamin B6 - 38% of recommended daily intake 👍🏼 Brussels sprouts - among 🔝20 most nutritious foods providing high amount of nutrients (195% of vitamin K, 125% of vitamin C and ~10% of vitamin A) for few calories (only ~40) 
And finally mushrooms - yummy antioxidant rich in  vitamins C, D, potassium and selenium 
Enjoy your food! Stay healthy! 😉</p>
