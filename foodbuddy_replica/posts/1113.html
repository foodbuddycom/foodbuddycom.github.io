        <p>Good morning! Don't know what to have for breakfast? Try a banana🍌-strawberry🍓-oatmeal-mint🍃 smoothie. It's very nutritious and easy to cook (just blend frozen strawberries and bananas with oatmeal, milk and vanilla extract) 👌🏼 you can have it on the go 🚶 if you are in a rush somewhere 😊 have a good day!</p>
