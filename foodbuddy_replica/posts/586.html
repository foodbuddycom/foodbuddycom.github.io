        <p>If this was fish and chips it would be 455 kCal meal with 11g of fat, 55g carbs, 32g protein ☝🏼however such meal wouldn't keep your level of satiety high for long, in couple of hours you would be hungry again. Why? Because you'd be lacking fiber that vegetables have. You would also miss many other important for your health micronutrients and vitamins. Stay healthy - try fish and salad 😁 tested on kids - they liked it! Download FoodBuddy tracker from AppStore (link is in the bio) - know what's on your plate 😉
