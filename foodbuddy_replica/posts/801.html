        <p>I did it guys! The North Face 100 Thailand! Thanks to your support - it meant a lot to me! Came 7/281, ran out of 12:00 🏃🏽😁! It was extremely hot day +38C / 100F and tough race profile - total gain 2.25 km/1.4 mi 🏃🏽☀️😰thanks to @foodbuddy.io nutrition plan and tracking  in combination with my stable trainings I achieved my best result so far - finished my longest race among TOP 10 Athletes 💪🏼</p>
