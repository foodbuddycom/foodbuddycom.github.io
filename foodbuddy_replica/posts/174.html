        <p>Hey everyone! I’m Calvin Sim @pedalingeggs, Team Singapore track cyclist 🚴🏼‍♂️ 2017 Southeast Asia Games Men’s Omnium 🥇winner and this is a #AthleteTakeover of @foodbuddy page 😁Over this weekend I will be sharing with you an insight into my training in Perth, Western Australia.
I am currently having a pre-season training camp together with @steve_and_keemeng (Singapore para-cycling team), building up my endurance for my upcoming 2020 track season. 
Cycling is a life changing sport for me. 15 years ago when I just started with mountain biking, I was very obese and cycling was a good leveler for me to be able to keep up with my ‘skinnier’ friends plus lose weight at the same time 😊
Cycling also allowed me to explore parts of Singapore that I never knew and most importantly, it brought me to many food places 🌯🥙🍜🍛😄! Food is always one of the best forms of motivation, I think you will agree 😉. Fast forward to 2020, I am currently training, on average, 30hrs per week 🚴🏼‍♂️ preparing to qualify and compete in the Track cycling world cups and Asian Track races towards the end of the year. 
Over the weekend, i will be sharing with you, my daily life during training camp and how I plan my nutrition to fuel and recover.

Happy weekend guys! Watch this space for more stories and posts from me 😎!
