        <p>Another great source of #potassium - RADISH! Well, it is definitely not a as delicious as banana 🍌 and potassium content is lower (233 vs 358 mg) but still high to help you enhance your muscle strength metabolism, blood flow, water balance and electrolytic functions!!! And what's great is that radish has low GI and digestible carbs, contains a lot of water, high in fiber, vitamin-C, and a great detoxifier! 👍🏼 definitely deserves a place in your salad bowl 🍴😉</p>
