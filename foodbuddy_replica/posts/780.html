        <p>Getting ready for 150 K ride around the island 🚵🏻. This power breakfast: blend of blueberries, strawberries 🍓 , banana 🍌 , Brazil nuts, walnuts and almonds, mix of chia, flax and oats, low fat yogurt with honey 🍯 - will be eaten 3 hours before the ride ☝🏼️🚴🏼 always give yourself enough time to metabolize the food to make sure you get the most out of your fuel 💪🏼and don't give a ride to a "passenger" 😂</p>
