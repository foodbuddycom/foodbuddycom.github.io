        <p>Garlic-lemon scallops, blanched broccoli with chili flakes and homemade hummus👌🏼🤤 Here’s few reasons why to add this delicious option to your list of healthy meals:
1️⃣ Well balanced: high in fiber, protein, complex carbs
2️⃣ Nutrient rich: high in vitamin B-12, B-6, A, C, magnesium, potassium, calcium, iron and many more
3️⃣ Perfect for your weight management: high fiber content in this meal will keep you away from snacks for long. Caveat: adjust portion to your needs (I had almost 3 of those after my 3 km swim and quick run 😜)
