        <p>Whenever I’m down I call on you my friend - a hearty chicken soup with buckwheat, celery, mushrooms, carrots and onion 🍲😋 and life becomes much better 🤗 Singapore has gone on semi-lockdown 😫 we are back to our WFH caves. Stay safe, dear friends and cook some healthy food to boost your mood 😜
I always choose chicken breast for my broth, it’s clean and lean - just how we like it 👌🏼and it cooks super fast - in 20-30 min the broth is done! Remove chicken breast, let is cool down, so you can cut it into small cubes later. Add chopped potatos(try to keep skin on if it’s not too old and thick, it has lots of valuable nutrients ☝🏼), fried buckwheat groats, mushrooms and finely chopped onion grated carrots and salt. To make your soup more flavourful - stir fry onion, mushrooms and carrots before adding the mix to the cooking soup. Cook until buckwheat and potatoes are cooked, add chicken cubes and mix your soup well! Enjoy 😉
