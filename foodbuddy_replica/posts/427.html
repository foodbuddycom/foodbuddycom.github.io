        <p>Few days ago we tried chia pudding with raspberry, banana, almond milk and topped with berries for the first time - very delicious and definitely must try all I can say 😋 don’t really like almond milk but in this pudding it was just right! If you look for light healthy breakfast - add this one to your list. If you want to keep going till lunch time - add rolled oats ☝🏼😉
