        <p>What’s your favourite veggie guys 🤔? Any vegetable you don’t like at all 🥴? Baked potato 🥔 takes special place in our heart 🥰 followed by fresh tomatoes 🍅 and baked or strewed eggplants 🍆 
Generally we try to mix as much veggies as possible in one dish to maximise nutritional value of different vegetables and also it always looks beautiful 😄 like a rainbow on a plate 🌈🍅🥕🌽🥦🍆 how about you?
