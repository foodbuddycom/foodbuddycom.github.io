        <p>Wait, was it Laurel Wassner @athletestyle cooking with me just few days ago?! Pinch me 😄 Want to see what's on the plate of one of the best triathletes in the World during fat loading phase before @ironman_taiwan - watch our video on YouTube (link in bio ☝🏼)! Laurel thanks for being our guest 😊 it was a great pleasure to spend some time with you before the race! Wishing you good luck on Sunday!
