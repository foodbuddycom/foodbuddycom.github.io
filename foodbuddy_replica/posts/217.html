        <p>⚠#Instagramtakeover ⚠ Hey @foodbuddy friends! I'm @chelsie_tan - #Singapore elite cyclist 🚴🏽‍♀ 🇸🇬I’m taking over @foodbuddy account and over the weekend will be sharing with you my sport journey, how I train, fuel myself and recover!😉 My journey as an elite cyclist started only in 2017. Prior to that I was a #triathlete (70.3 and full IM), a dragon boater, a netball player and a very lively and precocious child 😄! Triathlon was my main sport for 8 years and it was always hard for me to balance my teaching career, personal life and tough training schedule. Sometimes it felt like mission impossible 🤦🏻‍♀️! In April 2017 a friend from #bikelabz told me that #SingaporeCyclingFederation was holding a recruitment drive and I should go for it! So I found out the details, and promptly ignored it😬. However, when I saw the announcement about second recruitment in October 2017 I thought “this must be a sign!”☝🏼so I went for it. After “Wattbike test” (what a horrible test that is!) and great (for a girl 👧🏽) results, I was invited to join the national team 🚴🏽‍♀️🇸🇬. So I switched to road cycling, and the training is now even harder!! Soon after I started road racing I start showing pretty good results and in less than 2 years I have won regional races, competed in international races and just recently became the 2019 national road race champion🏅! Over this weekend I will be sharing with you in the stories all my hard training (usually it's 20 hr per week but don't worry, I'll be sharing just few 15 seconds snippets 😄) in preparation for the 2019 Southeast Asia Games!🇸🇬 It all sounds like an exciting story but none of what I do would be possible without the help of some very special people and organisations: my very supportive boyfriend (and training partner!), my cool coaches, and a fantastic club that supports me with all my races (thanks @bikelabz). Not to mention great sponsors and partners that help me with equipment for this exciting but expensive sport.
Stay tuned for the next post about my nutrition plan and the stories about my weekend training!😉
