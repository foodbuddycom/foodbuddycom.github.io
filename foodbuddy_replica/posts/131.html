        <p>Good morning! Whatâ€™s your favourite chia pudding recipe, please share? We tried this one: overnight chia (soaked in water, later added a bit of milk) with mango smoothie (frozen mango and low fat yogurt), berries and almonds - and liked it a lot! 
Save for yourself ðŸ˜‰ 
Ready to kick off Tuesday - one day closer to weekend and to end of our lockdown (itâ€™s day 43 of circuit breaker measures in Singapore! We never thought we could stay so long at home ðŸ˜„)! ___
