        <p>Happy Lunar New Year, folks! Gong Xi Fa Cai! Wishing everyone a healthy, blessed, prosperous and auspicious year of Ox! Last few days were filled with friends reunions -big and small (wish there were family reunions as well but not this time...), delicious food, laughter, karaoke ðŸŽ¤ðŸ˜„ interesting talks, absolutely happy time! Now when year of rat is definitely over it feels like we finished quarter 5 of 2020 ðŸ˜‚ finally itâ€™s behind us! 
Are you celebrating lunar new year? How do you do this?
