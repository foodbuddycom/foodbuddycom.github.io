        <p>How long would it take you guys to destroy this breakfast for 2? 😉 I bet some of us won't even need more than 5 min. It took us 25 min today as we are on a mission to eat sloooooowlyyyyyyyyy! 🤓🙄
Why? It's a wonderful and kind a sinful breakfast on a beautiful Sunday morning  so why hurry and stress- enjoy the moment! The other important reasons are: slow eating improves digestion (you know that the digestion starts in the mouth), helps lose weight (slow eating gives time to your brain to understand that you are full, it needs ~20 min. So you don't overpass the moment and don't overeat). Also slow eating diminished the harm of "sinful food" and fast food. 
Looks like slow eating is a new craze, people even invented smart fork☝🏼️😄 (google HAPIfork) that tracks the pace of your eating and vibrates in your mouth when you eat too fast 🙊😂</p>
