        <p>Quinoa with steamed eggplant 🍆 and cilantro - very beneficial meal for your health👍🏼. Quinoa is a great source of protein (contains all 9 essential amino acids), fiber, manganese, magnesium, potassium and many other important vitamins and minerals. Eggplant has only 20 calories per 100 g and packed with manganese, fiber, potassium, chlorogenic acid and nasunin - antioxidant compounds that help protect us from oxidation - harmful chemical process that damages cells. Eggplant recipe is from Ottolenghi's Plenty More - Once eggplant is cooked, marinate it for 10 min in mix of mirin, soya sauce, rice vinegar, ginger, garlic, maple syrup 👌🏼</p>
