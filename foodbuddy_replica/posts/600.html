        <p>Saturday treat after round the island ride 🚴🏼- breakfast in a local style 🍞🥚☕️ - traditional kaya toast set: white bread toasts with butter and coconut jam, 2 soft eggs, blended with dark soya, pepper and salt, and kopi c kosong (coffee with evaporated milk without sugar) a must have breakfast if you ever in Singapore 👍🏼 there are 2 schools of thought how to eat kaya toasts: 1. You need to dip kaya toasts into soft eggs 2. You sip soft eggs and eat kaya toasts separately 🤔 I prefer 1 - dip the toast - I like the sweet and sour flavor of kaya jam and soya eggs 👍🏼
