        <p>What a week ðŸ¤ª! Took the longest flight in the world twice in 4 days! (18 hr Singapore-New York and another 18 hr back home) had a crazy working schedule but luckily had a chance to meet with awesome @athletestyle and @athletefood for coffee on Monday morning in TriBeCa ðŸ˜Šthanks for lovely chat and awesome present (worth a separate post ðŸ˜„) Laurel and Rebeccah, looking forward to seeing you soon! 
P.S. New York, your coffee is great but your wind is soooo cold ðŸ¥¶ brrrrr ðŸ¥¶ and too strong - it took our plane 3 attempts to land in Newark because of the wind ðŸŒ¬ ðŸ˜± I almost regretted the chocolate that I ate few min before the landing ðŸ˜„) â€”
