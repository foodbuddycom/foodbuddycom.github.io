        <p>Oven baked rissoles with salad - yummy, healthy, protein and carbs rich dinner tonight ðŸ˜Š Rissoles are quite simple and fast: just mix 1 kg mincemeat (a mix of beef and pork meat is very delicious) with 2 minced onions and 2-3 minced potatoes, add 1 egg and a pinch of baking soda, salt and pepper to your taste. If you want rissoles to be more soft you may want to add white bread (soft part) to your mix. Put into oven for 15-20 min, 170 C ðŸ¤— enjoy your dinner!</p>
