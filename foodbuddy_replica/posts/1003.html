        <p>Today's healthy breakfast: 3 tbs (45 g) of oats porridge cooked on water without any sugar - sounds boring but in fact it's not at all when combined with fruits🍒🍇🍌🍏👌🏼 fruits are very healthy source of carbs, vitamins, micro-elements and sugar. Although some fruits contain more natural sugar, the fiber content in fruit slows your digestion and thereby prevents a spike in blood sugar that occurs with other sugary foods.💪🏼 eat healthy and stay fit! 😉</p>
