        <p>Help me Veggie Wan Kenobi, you are my only hope 🥗🙏🏻 End of the year in Singapore means lots of festive Christmas (calorie dense) lunches, dinners and RAINS 🎄🎅🏼⛈. Monsoon season, with winds from colder North Hemisphere, sweeps south-bound over East China Sea, collects all moisture and dumps it on to the top of Malaysian peninsula. City-state Singapore gets an incredible influence from the weather.
So do athletes!
No one wants to run or cycle and even swim in the rain 🌧 😖 as you can imagine it’s quite easy to lose training form that you worked hard for entire year 😩 so yes, loading on salads - high fiber, high nutrient, low calorie meal - is my only hope in December. What’s your Christmas survival plan? —
