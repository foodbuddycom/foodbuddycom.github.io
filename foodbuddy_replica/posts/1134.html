        <p>This picture is of Lance Armstrong, when he won a triathlon race in 1988 in Margarita Island. He was the triathlete rookie of the year at age 16. Finely tuned athletes are cosseted and deprived in equal measure. It's a combination of excess and ascetism – vast quantities of food, but with the tasty (fatty and sugary) bits taken out – that represents a much greater sacrifice than training eight hours a day... Armstrong, who survived testicular cancer in 1996, has an obsession with diet. He weighs his food down to the last gram and calculates, calorie by calorie, precisely how much nourishment his body needs. 30 minutes after exercise is the "glycogen window", when the body needs to replace the carbohydrate storage in the body. Glycogen depletion is a key cause of exhaustion, and so cyclists must quickly eat potatoes, pasta, rice or muesli. Later in the evening, Armstrong's dinner comprises lean steak or grilled chicken, potatoes or rice and steamed vegetables.</p>
