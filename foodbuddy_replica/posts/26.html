        <p>This week we are celebrating Maslenitsa aka Cheesefare Week ü•û!!! One of the most favourite traditions from the childhood‚ò∫Ô∏è! This is an Eastern Slavic  religious and folk holiday that takes place during last week before the Great Lent! Baking of crepes throughout the celebration week  is the key element of Maslenitsa! It‚Äôs such a happy holiday with lots of fun activities with deep meaning, which help people prepare mentally for the lent. We also had such a great time yesterday with friends eating delicious Russian crepes at @eatcetera.sg! As much as we want, we won‚Äôt eat pancakes every day of this week BUT we will definitely bake crepes at home on Sunday, which is the most important day of the holiday, also knows as Sunday of Forgiveness ‚ò∫Ô∏è what‚Äôs your favourite holiday? Share with us! üòâ
