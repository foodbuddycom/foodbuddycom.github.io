        <p>Breakfasts outside are quite entertaining - you can see how people around and city wake up, someone is super hero already at 8 am in the morning - cheerful and smiley 😁, someone is still grumpy until first cup of coffee and almost killing people passing by when opening door of cafe 😬 birds are always there to finish your breakfast, and veggie sandwich is not yet available because second staff hasn’t started his shift yet. Tuna and egg sandwich and cappuccino were delicious 😋 Do you usually have your breakfasts outside? What’s your favorite?
