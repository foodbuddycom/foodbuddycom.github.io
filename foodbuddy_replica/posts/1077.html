        <p>#lategram of the post marathon recovery meal that was consumed within seconds after the race on Sunday 😋 
Super iron-rich🌱, carb-rich🍝 and protein-rich 🍗 custom made 🌯 with baby spinach, quinoa, chicken breast, veggies and pasta on a side! 💪🏼👌🏼 Always remember to eat your recovery meal within one hour ⏱after the race finish ☝🏼️ Otherwise 💥 ouch! ouch! 💥 you body will sore very badly 😩</p>
