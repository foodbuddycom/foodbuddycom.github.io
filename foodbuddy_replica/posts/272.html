        <p>Favourite power breakfast! I craved for it, after long day at work and an active hill climbs bike session at Sentosa island yesterday 🚴🏼‍♂️ my run this morning 🏃🏽‍♂️was just 23 km, and I done it over a “sleep low” protocol. Did you know that a low intensity (60% max HR, endurance pace) training in the morning, in a fasting state after the night when BMR was still “switched on” can help you improve oxygen uptake and VO2max?.. BUT important note is, there should be a High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) like sprint track or hills reps work in the evening before. You can have a light meal with some protein for recovery but do not include carbohydrates at all ☝🏼That’s the essence of Sleep Low protocol: deplete glycogen with HIIT, then no replenishment, let BMR finish off the glycogen overnight, and do low-intensity Long Slow Distance or endurance activating fat stores! VO2max surge, where are you?.. —
