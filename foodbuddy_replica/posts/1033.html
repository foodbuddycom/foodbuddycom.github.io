        <p>Breaking ⚡️📰🗞📯❗️ Paleo diet=weight gain based on latest article from University of Melbourne Department of Medicine!!! Experiments on mice 🐁🐁proved that low carb high fat (LCHF) diet - which Paleo diet is - may "instead make you fat and even cause symptoms of pre-diabetes". The experiment completely disproved the initial hypothesis that the Paleo diet group of mice would gain less weight and show improvements in glycemic control. Instead, they gained 1️⃣5️⃣% of their body weight and their fat mass doubled from 2️⃣ % to almost 4️⃣%. “In humans, this level of weight gain will increase blood pressure and the risk of anxiety and depression and may cause bone issues and arthritis,” Associate Professor Andrikopoulos says. 
NOW❓❓❓: who is practicing Paleo diet and what's your opinion?🤔</p>
