        <p>This is very delicious recipe and not so time consuming. Marinate beef or lamb cubes for several hours in the mix of: 1/2 cup of dry 🍷, 1/4 of red wine vinegar, 2 tbsp fresh chopped rosemary, 4 minced garlic cloves, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp 🌶 flakes and black pepper. Stew meat (will cook very fast) and add to quinoa (or any other garnish of your choice) - enjoy 😊</p>
