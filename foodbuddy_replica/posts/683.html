        <p>Roasted in oven veggies with thyme, cumin, cayenne and black pepper, garlic, salt and olive oil. It's one of the easiest and the most delicious vegetable dishes! Boring vegetables become so rich and complex in flavour when they are roasted 👌🏼 they get cameralized in their own natural sugar and in combination with herbs and spices become simply irresistible 😄 just cut veggies and mix them with olive oil, herbs and spices that you love and roast in the oven for 30-45 min at ~ 180C/356F. -------
