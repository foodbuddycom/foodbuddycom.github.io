        <p>Today for breakfast - a big bowl of fruit salad for 2 (2 🍎, 2 🍌, 2 🍊 , 1/2 🍍) There is less fat and protein and more carbohydrate in fruits than in vegetables. Vegetables contain carbs in starches. Most of the carbs in fruits are sugars, the good ones (fructose predominantly). However, as a general rule, there's slightly less minerals in fruits category, as compared to veggies ☝🏼</p>
