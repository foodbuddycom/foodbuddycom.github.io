        <p>Hello Sunday! Still can't believe that there's no more haze in Singapore!!! 😀 We never missed our bikes so much as We've missed it recently because of haze. Just finished a home-made power brunch: avocado-mushroom-walnut-tomato salad, seasoned with olive oil, sesame seeds, celery and pea shoots 🍅🌿 (you'll be surprised how filling this meal is💪🏼💪🏼) we are off for a nice Sunday ride 🚴🏼🚴🏼 and what are you up to? 😉</p>
