        <p>Soba noodle soup🍜 👍🏼 soba noodles are made of buckwheat flour which makes it less caloric, richer in fiber, protein and manganese than traditional wheat noodle. Soba doesn't offer a lot of vitamins but it is very rich in manganese which makes up a component of several enzymes, including those needed to convert food into energy and antioxidant enzymes, it also helps make collagen, a protein required for wound healing. Important to note that soba has high GI which can spike your blood sugar levels ☝🏼 #triathlon #ironmantri #healthyfood  #sportnutrition #running #swimbikerun #marathon #dietfood #cervelo #orbea #specializedbikes #giantbikes #canyonbikes #bmcbikes #boardmanbikes #trailrunning #ironmantraining #marathontraining</p>
