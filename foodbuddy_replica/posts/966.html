        <p>My breakfast today was packed with potassium - one of the most important electrolytes for endurance athletes 🏊🏼🚴🏼🏃🏼(it is essential for regulating muscle and nerve activity) bananas and kiwi fruit are extremely rich in potassium and should be part of the daily diet of every endurance athlete. 
Kiwi fruit is overlooked most of the time (I guess it is just harder to peel compared to bananas 😄), however, it deserves a lot of attention for the following reasons: - It's extremely rich in vitamins C, K (cup of slices kiwis will give you 278%  of C and 89% of K of daily norm) - it's low in calories and high in fiber ( 108 Cal, 5 g fiber per cup) - it is rich in free radical-fighting antioxidants 👊🏼
- it improves cholesterol and the health of the GI tract 👍🏼</p>
