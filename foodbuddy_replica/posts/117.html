        <p>Good morning! Weâ€™re big believers in breakfasts. Never skip one, unless absolutely impossible or prescribed! Training fasted from yesterdayâ€™s intervals, 6:00am run, and a delicious â€˜brekkieâ€™ (as itâ€™s referred to in Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º) as a demarcation line before the full-on business day ahead. 
This Tuesday is an awesome day because (a) we have freshly baked bread (b) there are delicious scrambled eggs on toasted slice of our homemade breadðŸ˜‹ (c) last night we got announcement that Singapore is moving to Phase 2 reopening after lockdown ðŸ˜ƒ! From Friday we can meet our friends and dine out! Playgrounds will be open and sport activities will resume! 
So yes, this Tuesday is an awesome day with positive news, plans for weekend, smell of coffee and taste of delicious breakfast! 
What are your Tuesday specials? Any positive news or delicious breakfast? ðŸ˜‰
