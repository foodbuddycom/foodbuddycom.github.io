        <p>Blessings to all Athletes from Tibet 🙏🏻🌞 this week Foodbuddy is on vacation, exploring different parts of China and of course its cuisine. Welcome steamed vegetable momo - traditional Tibetan dish and local Lhasa beer 🍺 it's very delicious I should say, however, most of the Tibetan food is very fatty. Well, you need a lot of energy leaving rural life almost 4,000 meters above the sea ☝🏼️😧</p>
