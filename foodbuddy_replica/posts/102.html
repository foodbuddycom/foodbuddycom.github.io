HERE’S RECIPE ⬇️
-
Ingredients:

For pizza dough
➖380 g/13 oz plain flour
➖270 g/9.5 oz water 
➖9 g/ 0.3 oz salt 
➖3 g/0.1 oz yeast 
➖9 g/ 0.3 oz olive oil 

For topping: 
➖1 tsp. olive oil
➖1 clove garlic diced
➖8 oz. cream cheese
➖salt and pepper to taste
➖2 potatoes thinly sliced 
➖red onion thinly sliced, to taste
➖2-4 green chilli diced (we used homemade marinated green chilli, thank you auntie Lucy)
➖parmesan cheese to taste
➖garlic powder to taste
➖cilantro for topping (optional) 

Cooking method:
➖ mix all dough ingredients and make a dough. Set it aside for about 1 hr so it can rise. 
➖in the meanwhile preheat oven to 250C/482F degrees.
➖Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add garlic, cream cheese, salt and pepper and saute until the garlic is fragrant, the cream cheese is smooth and everything is combined.
➖ place your dough on a flour-dusted surface and roll it to the shape you want, not to thick, ~0.5 cm. 
➖ Spray your baking sheet with oil. Place dough on the sheet, add cream cheese sauce and spread evenly, leaving some space of crust along the edges.
Top with potatoes, red onions and chilli. Sprinkle pizza with parmesan cheese and garlic powder and place in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until crust is brown and crispy.
ENJOY!
