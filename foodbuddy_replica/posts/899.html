        <p>Ready, set, go!!! Pre-race breakfast 🏁 🏃 Normally, carb supplies are half depleted after the overnight fast😴, so breakfast on the race day is very important☝🏼️. It is your last chance to restore your liver glycogen. The ideal breakfast should be high in carbs and low in protein, fat and fiber (high glycemic foods typically). Remember that pre-race breakfast must be very familiar to your stomach (no last minute surprises ⛔️) - so here's usual @foodbuddy.io Oatmeal-Chia with grated walnuts and brazil nuts breakfast (eh, missing 🍌) - this will be a portion for 4 pax once it's soaked in hot water. And more important - the breakfast must be taken 4 to 2 hours before the race ☝🏼️if you eat as early as 4 hours before the race the breakfast should provide 4g carbs per kg of your body weight. If 2 hours before - 1-3g of carbs per kg of your body weight. Good luck! 💪🏼</p>
