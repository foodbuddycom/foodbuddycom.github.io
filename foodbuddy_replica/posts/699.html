        <p>Eggs, beans and salad breakfast I made for #audax200 #weekendwarrior 🚴🏼 as part of his pre-race meal: 1/2 cup of mung beans, 2 eggs, fried but without oil, 1 cup of avocado-edamame beans-peas-green chili salad with olive oil and vinegar dressing. This definitely wouldn't be enough for good quality ride, hence there was an oatmeal-chia porridge couple of hours before 😬👍🏼 all the best to #audax riders tomorrow 💪🏼 ---------- #triathlon #ironmantri #healthyfood  #sportnutrition #running #swimbikerun #dietfood #cervelo #orbea #specializedbikes #giantbikes #canyonbikes #bmcbikes #boardmanbikes #ironmantraining #marathontraining #powerfood #beans #powerbreakfast</p>
