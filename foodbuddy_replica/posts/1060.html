        <p>A very curious article about training, diet and racing of a vegan ultra marathon trail runner Vlad Ixel @vladixel in the Bangkok post 🤔 indeed, most of the time we try our best to eat a light dinner, especially before the bed time, but I agree with Vlad's point that his biggest meal is dinner because sleep is our biggest recovery period and the only way for muscles to recover is to get blood moving through them... ☝🏼️what do you guys think? I personally feel less guilty for my late big dinners 😁🍝
