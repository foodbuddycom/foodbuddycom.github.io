        <p>Had an honour to chat with @pugh_topia on all things #nutrition and #endurance on his #enduranceasia podcast. Big goal ahead, an attempt of #HK4TUC and an interim #everesting of Bukit-Timah in Singapore. Was a good chat, a bit too long, but covered a hell of a lot of topics! From @nuzest_singapore to #LCHF to beetroot juice to peptides to EER, diving in to my personal story, getting back to race morning preparations, emptying out ‚Äúthe passengers‚Äù and so on. For me, it was a whole new format, really enjoyed the banter! Maybe you need to 1.25x it though, hehehe üòÇ 
Dropped few shout-out to my mentors, coaches and people of stellar inspiration: @aublumberg #hk4tuc
