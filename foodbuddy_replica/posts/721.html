        <p>#audax 400km ✅ 🚴🏼😬😰! It was hard even for #garmin #forerunner - on 300 km the battery died. Good news I got power bank and charged just in time 👍🏻 finally, after 13 hours roll time, I'm happy to be home and eating recovery meal ☺️😋: beef soba noodle soup, brown rice with shiitake mushrooms, ginger & garlic; stir fry bell-peppers, onion, grilled chicken, and hummus ☺️ and if you ask me why do I do this crazy stuff sacrificing Saturday 🤔 here's my motivation: such rides hardening the most important muscle in your body - THE ONE BETWEEN THE EARS 😉 they bring you to a completely different state of mind. 180 km Ironman distance is no longer a challenge! It's just slightly less than half of what you did THAT crazy Saturday.  #audax400  #triathlon #ironmantri #healthyfood  #sportnutrition #running #swimbikerun #dietfood #cervelo #orbea #specializedbikes #giantbikes #canyonbikes #bmcbikes #boardmanbikes #recoverymeal</p>
