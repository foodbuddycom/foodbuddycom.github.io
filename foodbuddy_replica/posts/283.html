        <p>How are you doing guys? This week is quite crazy for us 🤪😰 I bet most of you are also trying to finish everything you planned for 2018 (but haven’t done yet) and save the world before the year ends 😄 if yes - double tap and save this simple and super-quick snack recipe which we dubbed “lazy hummus”. Just take all ingredients that you would use for hummus and stew them in a sauce pan for 5-10 min: 1 can of cooked chickpea, sesame seeds, lemon juice, olive oil, paprika, minced garlic (optional), salt and pepper. Absolutely delicious both hot and cold👌🏼😋 —
