        <p>Today I experienced the power of a recovery meal like never before‼️ I did my usual 120km around the island 🚴🏼 but, after a long break in cycling, I completely forgot to refill my bento bag with energy gels 😱 only on ~40th km I realised that I have one and ONLY gel⚡️so the other 80 km I did on isotonic drink and the fats that I gained during Christmas and New Year break 🍲😁🍜

No wonder happened to me - I, as I expected, cramped severely 😖 so the first thing I did, made a proper portion of the recovery meal (1.5g of carbs per every kg of weight): pasta with creamy mushrooms and onion 🍝 😊 Dear Pasta, you saved me and made my day! Viva la recovery meal 😉😋</p>
