        <p>Yesterday was Lily’s birthday and we decided to surprise her with a special cake. We wanted it to look like a pile of traditional Tatar meat pies - Echpochmaks, which she loves so much 😄, but taste like a chocolate cake. A bit crazy idea and we really didn’t know what would be an outcome (many patisseries rejected our project 😬) BUT we didn’t give up and got so lucky to meet amazing team from @sooperlicious who were friendly, patient and so creative! The result was outstanding - not only we got a pile of so authentically looking pies but also a fantastic chocolate cake covered with “table cloth” with traditional ornaments 😄👌🏼 this cake is a piece of art inside out! ☺️ thank you @sooperlicious team!
