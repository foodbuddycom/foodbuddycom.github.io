        <p>Highlight of this week was this fantastic beef and veggie stew with soba noodles. Save this recipe, it‚Äôs so worth to try ü§§

STEW INGREDIENTS: 
- coconut and sunflower oil (1 tbsp each)
beef ( 500 g cut into cubes) 
buna-shimeji mushrooms (2 pack)
- eggplants (3 medium) 
- onion (1 big)
- ginger (1 inch-size piece) 
- garlic (optional) 
- curry paste (1 tbsp or to your taste) 
- salt and pepper to your taste 

COOKING METHOD:
- in a large pan preheat oil and add onion, garlic and ginger. Stir fry until golden. 
- add beef and stir fry until it‚Äôs semi-cooked
- add mushrooms and eggplants, cook until beef and veggies are soft. 
- lastly add curry paste, salt and pepper and stir fry few min. 

SOBA - BUCKWHEAT NOODLES!!!
Cook as any other noodles: bring water to boil and add soba, it will be cooked just in few min, really fast. Keep an eye on it as it‚Äôs so easy to overcook it (it‚Äôs not nice at all). Drain it and keep aside. Rinse it with water before serving otherwise it will stick together and your serving will look ugly üòñ
