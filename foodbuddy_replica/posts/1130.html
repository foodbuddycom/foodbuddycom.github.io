        <p>We love to include sesame seeds to the salad - they taste good and are an excellent source of micro-elements BUT they make the balance of omega 3 and omega 6 fats awful!!!! ðŸ˜• Sesame seeds have 1âƒ£1âƒ£3âƒ£8âƒ£ times more of omega 6 than omega 3, when the healthy balance should be 2âƒ£:1âƒ£ðŸ˜±ðŸ™ˆ in order to reduce the risk of many chronic diseases such as diabetes, strokes, cancers etc. If you are interested in omega3/omega6 balance check out www.efaeducation.org</p>
