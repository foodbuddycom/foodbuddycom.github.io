        <p>What I like about traveling for sport experience, especially to northern countries❄️⛷, is that after a good workout on cold, fresh air, you feel yourself entitled for a good portion of local delicacies without any doubt or guilt for consumption of extra calories 😋 - as they definitely burn 🔥on -17 C❄️! Enjoying the XC skiing 🎿in Finland with taste 👌🏼A smoked salmon filet with piece of rye bread after 15 K skate style hill climbs💪🏼</p>
