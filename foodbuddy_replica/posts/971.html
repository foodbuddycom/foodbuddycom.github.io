        <p>Introducing myself to Taiwanese delicacies today! 😊

This beef broth with hand-made noodle was perfect and exactly what I needed after stressful week! 😰 ➡️ ☺️ I'm sure you know that broth health benefits are much more than just a help with cold and flu. Homemade bone broth is great for athletes as well💪🏼. It is an excellent source of minerals, like calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium, in forms that your body can easily absorb. It’s also rich in amino acids, collagen and anti-inflammatory compounds, like chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine! 👍🏼🍜</p>
