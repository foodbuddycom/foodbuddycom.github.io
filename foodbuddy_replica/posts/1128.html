        <p>Today's lunch: avocado-prawn salad! One of us LOVES #prawns 💓🍤💓 and will try to convince you guys why prawns are awesome. According to American Journal of Clinical Nutrition eating prawns is part of a heart ❤️healthy diet. 1. Prawns provide a complete protein - includes all nine amino acids in the right proportion for the body to function properly.💪🏼 2. 100 grams of prawns contain about 25 grams of protein - almost same as chicken or beef BUT but only 115 calories, which is half as much as chicken, 3 times less than beef.👌🏼3. Yes, prawns contain higher than avg amounts of cholesterol, but they do not lead to cholesterol levels in the body due to their healthy fat profile.👏🏼And this is due to the  next fact 4. Prawns contain almost 3 times more #Omega3 fatty acid than Omega 6 fatty acid. ☝🏼And the last one 5. Prawns are rich in Vitamins B-6, B-12 and Niacin, contain significant amount if iron, selenium, zinc, phosphorous, copper and magnesium! 😀👍🏼 hope this will be enough to make you try eat prawns (if not yet) those with prawns allergy - we feel for you! 😩 take care 😉</p>
