        <p>We could eat mango and star fruit all day long 😋 especially now when it’s a mango and star fruit season in Southeast Asia BUT this would definitely lead to some health consequences like vitamin C allergy reaction or problem with kidneys (yes, high consumption of star fruit may have a negative impact on your kidneys (cause kidney stones) because of high oxalate content ☝🏼). So moderation is important, which is the hardest part 😩 as we got the most delicious mangos 🥭 from the garden of our friend in The Philippines 🤤 and it is much easier to find ripe and sweet starfruit in a grocery store or wet market these days👌🏼 anyway, it’s worth do add both fruits to your diet, they are low in calories, but very rich in fiber, vitamin C (great boosters to our immune system) antioxidants and many other vitamins and micro elements 👍🏼 😉
