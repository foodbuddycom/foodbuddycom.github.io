        <p>A bowl of oatmeal porridge 🍲 with slices of banana🍌, apple🍎 and walnuts is always a great choice of breakfast. 👍🏼
I hope you don't hate porridge anymore, like you probably did in your childhood 😉 😷 as its one of the best and the most affordable super-foods in this world😊: 1️⃣ Oatmeal Porridge - has complex carbs and a very low Glycaemic Index, this means it is slowly absorbed into the body’s blood stream. Such source of energy will serve you quite a long time and prevent you from overeating. Also it will help keep your blood sugar levels stable. 👍🏼 2️⃣ Porridge is high in protein which is made up of long chains ⛓of amino acid subunits. Many of these are not made or stored in the body, so it is essential we get plenty of them in our diet. 
3️⃣ Porridge with fruits is high in fibre that protects your ❤️ and ⬇️ blood pressure. 
4️⃣ Ladies, oatmeal porridge also improves the quality of your skin in so many ways! 💁🏼 save some money on beautician 😉 
5️⃣ Finally, porridge can help fight winter depression 😩👊🏼 Porridge is high in the Vitamin B6 which encourages the brain to produce Serotonin🙃, this can be associated with feelings of well being, relaxation and aid restful sleep👌🏼</p>
