        <p>Yesterday I had some left over of chia-flax-oat mix (soaked in hot water) so I decided to add a blend of dry apricots, prunes and desiccated coconut and made this wonderful healthy snack 👍🏼complemented by 🍌banana-mango smoothie 😊 (frozen fruits blended with low fat yogurt and milk) - very yummy! 😋</p>
