        <p>Hey iPhone users with Garmin watch - you can download FoodBuddy Tracker that allows you to track your nutrition, carbs and protein demand vs your trainings & nutrition, check what other athletes eat and post your meals with awesome nutrition info watermarks to social media 👍🏼! Link in the bio of profile ☝🏼 Change in my nutrition helped me achieve triathlon goal that I DIDN'T even think about 2.5 years ago! During last 4 months, I finished 7th in Ultra 100 km trail run, ridden Audax 400 km on road bike, and this Sunday - finished FULL Ironman 140.6 in 10h39m among top 25% in my age group. And yeah, after that I danced to AC/DC "Thunderstrike" at finish line 😄 Guys, without cramps or hitting the wall. I developed FoodBuddy Tracker based on endurance nutrition plan that I myself live by! I REALLY believe it can also help all of us to achieve your goals! 💪🏼🏊🏼🚴🏼🏃🏽
