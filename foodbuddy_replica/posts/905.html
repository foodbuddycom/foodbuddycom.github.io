        <p>Nuts are great for Athletes, their value has been emphasised many times at @foodbuddy.io 👍🏼 especially beneficial Brazil nuts and walnuts and one of the reasons why is because they are high in polyunsaturated fats ☝🏼️ This is also the reason why they may turn rancid and deteriorate early if remain exposed to air, humidity and sunlight (hmm 🤔 sounds like Singapore 😜) so if you like and buy nuts a lot, better keep them in cool, dry place or in the fridge 👍🏼 #lifehacks</p>
