        <p>@foodbuddy is ready to rock on #standardcharteredmarathon2016! 😁Feeling great: fuelled with power mix 3 hours before the race start (1/4 cup of oats, 1/4 cup of Chia, 1/4 cup of flax, handful of nuts: walnuts, Brazil nuts, macadamia) hydrated and motivated by new outfit! 💪🏼👊🏼🏃🏽😁👍🏼 and my cool @foodbuddy.io banana-broccoli shoelaces will cheer me up and help move on every time I have no more strength to look ahead but only down. Good luck to all marathon runners this weekend! 🏃🏽👍🏼</p>
