        <p>I eat a lot of carbs, complex carbs that are rich in fiber and other nutrients: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes and beans, nuts and seeds - love them all! Fiber can‚Äôt be digested by our bodies which is a great benefit for our health! Because of fiber you won‚Äôt overeat and it will be much easier to manage weight. It creates a bulk in your stomach and you will feel as full as you would feel after eating, let‚Äôs say, a üçî with the major difference that nutritional benefits of burger are more on negative side (processed meat, fatty cheese, saturated fats, buns made of refined grains) satiety from burger would last less longer than from good old oatmeal porridge with fruits, or big plate with baked veggies and buckwheat porridge that you see on the picture. Fiber is essential for your bowel health and movement (specifically insoluble fiber - whole-wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, beans and vegetables, such as cauliflower, green beans and potatoes); cholesterol and blood sugar level (specifically soluble fiber: oats, peas, beans, apples, citrus fruits, carrots, barley and psyllium). So, make sure you have enough of plant based food throughout your week. On a daily basis men and women under 50 y.o. need 38 g and 25 g of fiber respectively; over 50 y.o: 30g and 21 g respectively.
