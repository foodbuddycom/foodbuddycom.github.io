        <p>Flax seeds are truly magical seeds ✨ just think about it 🤔: they are high in fiber and low in carbs - its mucilage gum content (gel-forming fiber that is water soluble) can keep food in the stomach from emptying too quickly, hence can increase nutrient absorption 👍🏼 also flax seeds are rich in soluble and insoluble fiber which can support fat loss, reduce sugar cravings and colon detoxification. Flax seeds are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids ALA which help reduce inflammation. They are gluten free and rich in anti-oxidants! And these are not the only benefits of flax seeds 💪🏼 add 1-2 tbsp of flax seeds to your breakfast fruit bowl or smoothie every day - enjoy and stay healthy 😊</p>
