        <p>Aromatic chai masala with fruits 😋👌🏼chai masala is a black tea with spices and milk - popular drink in India. Because it contains so many different spices, it is very beneficial for your health. There are plenty of different chai masala recipes, I have 7 spice chai masala powder that is made of black tea extract (powerful antioxidant) and such spices as cinnamon (beneficial for controlling the blood sugar), star anise (fights cough, flu, indigestion, constipation), cardamom (strengthens immune system, helps with digestion), nutmeg (relieves pain, soothes indigestion, detoxifies the body), ginger (reduces inflammation in the body), cloves (helps fight the ulcer pain and aids in the digestion process) and black pepper (boosts metabolism and fights bacteria and gastrointestinal diseases). If you haven't tried - I strongly recommend 👍🏼
