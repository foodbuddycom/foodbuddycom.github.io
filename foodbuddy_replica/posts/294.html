        <p>This dish has very nice mixture of flavors: sweet and spicy and sour and fresh 😋 mix all ingredients (ex. fennel, curry and coriander leaves) season well with olive oil, salt and pepper and bake for 20 min at 200 degrees C/392 F. Add thinly sliced fennel, curry leaves and bake for another 10 min. Top up with coriander leaves when serving. I used 3 big carrots, 1 yam, 1 big fennel, 2 tsp of curry powder, 3 tbsp of lemon juice + grated zest of 1 lemon, 4 tbsp of olive oil, salt and pepper to your taste 👌🏼
