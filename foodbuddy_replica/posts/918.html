        <p>Which events or Long Trainings you up to  this weekend? Anyone doing carbo loading? Hi 5 then 👋🏼 Consider this breakfast: chia pudding with figs (it's a season now!..), banana, berries and walnuts - for your carb loading day 💪🏼 Walnuts give needed polyunsaturated fats, and altogether this bowl totals ~130g carbs in one go! For 6g/kg loading, that's almost 30% of a 150lb athlete's need, or 50% if you're a sub-60 kg! Top it up with pasta and... Here you go, enough for a race day with gels and bananas on the course!👍🏼😊</p>
