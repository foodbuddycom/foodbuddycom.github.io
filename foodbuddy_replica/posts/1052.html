        <p>If you were looking for an alternative to not so healthy fried eggs and boring boiled eggs, try eggs in clouds ⛅️😊 . It's very simple and delicious: whip egg whites into "clouds" mix with blended mushrooms and onions (can be anything else, e.g. beacon with chives), add salt and pepper to your taste and bake in the oven for 3 min (230 C degree). Then add egg yolks to every cloud and bake for another 3 min! Enjoy!!! 🤗</p>
