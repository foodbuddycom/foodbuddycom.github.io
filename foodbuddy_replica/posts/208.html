        <p>We always wondered what does the fastest runner in Singapore @runsohfast eat to fuel his fantastic performance (2:23:42 - full marathon) 🤔 and we got a chance to ask him personally, over some delicious food of course 😋 
Here’s what we’ve learned: 
1⃣ Carbs are essential in Rui’s Everyday diet as he burns about 1000 calories on a daily 16km run 🏃🏻‍♂️not to mention the added calorie burn from the increased metabolism after that. To fuel his high calorie burn, Rui consumes lots of bread 🥖rice 🍚 and pasta 🍝 . Wholemeal if possible because it is less processed and burns slower ☝🏼.
2⃣ Vitamins are the second most important block of daily nutrition. “I try to get a colorful variety of fruits and vegetables in my diet. Thankfully in Singapore, we can easily get fresh fruit juice. My favorites include orange 🍊 , pineapple 🍍 , soursop, rockmelon and avocado 🥑 fruit juices. These provide a range of different vitamjns that help keep my immune system in check admist long work hours and hard training sessions”, - says Rui. 
3⃣ Lastly, protein to rebuild muscles after hard sessions. Rui, as many of us, gets his protein from chicken, beef , pork, tofu and chocolate milk.

In general, The fastest runner in Singapore, doesn’t count calories or stress out over his food, but he enjoys getting in a colourful variety of foods every day and that helps him keep a good dietary balance and great sport results 👍🏼🏃🏻‍♂️ It makes a lot of sense for the amount of training Rui has on a weekly basis (don’t think we can afford great variety of bread and rice on our plate 😬unless we start running “Soh fast” 😅). Thanks Rui for your time and for sharing your daily nutrition tips with us!
