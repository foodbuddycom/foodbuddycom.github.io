        <p>🍎Apple quinoa porridge with grapes 🍇 blueberries, banana 🍌 and cinnamon - about 256 calories, 55 g of carbs, 2.4 g of fat, 7.3 g of proteins. Quinoa deserves its Power Food title crown 👑 it is gluten free, composes almost all of the essential amino acids required for bodies at the best proportion (rich in lysine which is a limiting amino acid in grains like wheat, maize and rice...), great source of soluble and insoluble dietary fiber (helps you feel satiety for a longer period of time), rich in vitamins A, E, B complex and minerals such as Iron, Copper, Calcium, Potassium, Manganese, and Magnesium 💪🏼#triathlon #ironmantri #healthyfood  #sportnutrition #running #swimbikerun #marathon #dietfood #cervelo #orbea #specializedbikes #giantbikes #canyonbikes #bmcbikes #boardmanbikes #trailrunning #trailrun #quinoa</p>
