        <p>Why do I love this type of breakfast and stick to it? First of all it is very delicious 😋 so I don't have to force myself to eat it, instead it is my motivation to wake up every morning ☀️. Secondly, it is rich in fiber (oats, chia, fruits and berries have high content of fiber) and I don't feel hungry till lunch time without any snacks. Also, my energy level is very high for a long period of time as oats and chia have low GI which means that both grains provide a sustained release of energy into bloodstream. Berries and chia a packed with antioxidants so I'm sure that my cells are protected from damage of free radicals. 
Chia and oats are great source of protein that will help me repair my, most of the time, sore muscles, and I don't have to get protein from meat (moving away from animal protein).
I love the fact that my breakfast is packed with microelements that support my immune system, benefit my overall appearance and body functions. And I love how chia seeds, blackberries seeds and  blueberries pop up when I bite them 😋 ------ #triathlon #ironmantri #healthyfood  #sportnutrition #running #swimbikerun #dietfood #cervelo #orbea #specializedbikes #giantbikes #canyonbikes #bmcbikes #boardmanbikes #ironmantraining #marathontraining #trailrunning #marathon #powerbreakfast #porridge #lovemybreakfast</p>
