        <p>Strong teamwork at #imcairns with @team_integratedriding mates Steve and Garry!.. And Thiam Sing, the owner of #integratedriding pan-Singapore best LBS! Steve is in one of the pictures here as well, fooling around at next day’s morning calm beach. He bumped in to me half year ago in airport lounge and I forced him to register, then we somehow lured Garry as well. Both of these Brits (with Steve vein the Chav for sure) done inaugural 140.6. Wicked as it can be, all three ended up in T2 60 seconds apart from one another. Tough feature-rich Cairns headwinds ride was a chase among us, with gaps of 2 min max while winning back from 109->39 category position in my case. Imagine what would’ve I pulled off if I was training swim (at all?.. more?.. better?..). We reversed the order from me being 3rd from T1 due to bottle launch to me surging in to marathon first. Absolutely massive efforts! Teamwork makes the dreamwork! You two are hardcore, enjoy time off, mates! Thiam Sing, you’re rockstar!
