        <p>TGIF guys!!! 😊 Yesterday night we accidentally found flax seeds in our medicine chest. Some time ago our Friend gave them to us as a remedy for gastritis. Fortunately we don't have gastritis and we end up with pretty much all ingredient for Super-food breakfast! Chia, flax, pumpkin seeds, macadamia nuts, walnut, almonds, banana and oatmeal covered with good portion of yoghurt 👍🏼💪🏼 ready to enjoy our day 😄😃 hope you too!</p>
