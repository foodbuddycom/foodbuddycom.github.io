        <p>My daily dose of lean proteins, omega-3 and vitamin B - grilled tuna 🐟💪🏼 btw, American Heart Association ❤️ recommends to eat fish rich in omega-3 acids twice a week ☝🏼️and don't be too worry about side effect of mercury in tuna. Tuna contains selenium in the form of selenoneine which is able to bind together with mercury compounds in the fish's body (including methyl mercury, or MeHg) and lower their risk of mercury-related problems. Selenoneine is also a great antioxidant both for tuna and people ✌🏼</p>
