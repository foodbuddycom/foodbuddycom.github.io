        <p>To elaborate more on pre-race fat loading phase and its benefit: Researches proved that "fat loading during tapering increases reliance on fat and decrease reliance on glycogen as exercise fuel, while subsequent carbo loading would maximize glycogen stores without negating the effect of fat loading". This approach helps to save more glycogen and reduces chance of an athlete to "hit the wall" during the race. 
Fat-loading is considered as an optional tapering phase. In case you decided to try it, here's another  fat loading breakfast option: 3 egg omelette 🍳 with cheese 🧀 soooo fat, soooo good! 😁😋</p>
