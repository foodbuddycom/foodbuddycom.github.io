        <p>One of our favourite soups is Sichuan hot and sour soup 🍲. It is a popular dish in China especially during cold season. But we LOVE it in hot and humid everlasting summer in Singapore too! ⠀
This is the very first time I cooked it at home, usually we had it only when we ate outside. Thank you lockdown for pushing our cooking limits 😄  I actually thought it would be so complicated to cook Sichuan soup, but it wasn't hard at all, well, a bit of chopping is required... ⠀
Anyway, please DO repeat it at home 😁  this soup is PACKED with nutrients and tastes so good! Please note, that it's spicy 🔥 ! ⠀
