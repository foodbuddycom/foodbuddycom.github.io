        <p>How is your weekend guys? What are you up to? Whatâ€™s cooking ðŸ˜‰ ?
We have friends reunion and Chinese New Year celebration dinner which means - lots of delicious food! Also 177 km of cycling to mount Kulai in Johor, Malaysia made Arseny craving for some smoothie and I made this awesome bowl, one of the best Iâ€™ve made so far! Save this recipe: 3 tbsp of frozen aÃ§ai berry, 200 g of fresh and frozen blueberries, handful of frozen strawberries, 1 banana, 6 prunes, 2 tbsp of cocoa unsweetened powder, 1 portion of #nuzest vanilla #cleanleanprotein 1 cup of low fat plain yogurt - itâ€™s yummy till the last drop ðŸ¤¤ â€”
