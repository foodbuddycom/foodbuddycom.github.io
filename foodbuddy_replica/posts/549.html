        <p>Sharing my recovery nutrition after 200 km ride: beetroot-chickpeas-kale-capers salad and super delicious quinoa-potato-squid stewed in tomato pure with garlic, onion, ground cumin & chilli flakes.
Any sport exercise requires a recovery afterwards. Recovery meal is important during first hour after workout. Your dietary goal is to provide adequate fluids, electrolytes, energy, and carbohydrates to replace muscle glycogen and ensure rapid recovery. Carbs and protein should be consumed in correct proportions. Extensive training (e.g. running 20 km and above) will require a carbohydrate intake of approximately 1.0-1.5 g per 1 kg of body weight during the first 30 min and again every 2 h for 4-6 h will be adequate to replace glycogen stores. Protein in proportion of 1 g per every 4 g of carbs consumed after exercise will provide amino acids for building and repair of muscle tissue. If your training is light, then your carbs and protein intake can be half as much of proportions mentioned above.
