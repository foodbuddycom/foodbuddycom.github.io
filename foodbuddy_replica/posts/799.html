        <p>Imam Bayildi - one the delights of Turkish cuisine - is so delicious and rich in nutrients 😋! However the traditional recipe has a lot of oil and sugar. This one is much lighter and still delicious. P.S. You may end up with left over of the tomato-onion-garlic-herbs mix. I added buckwheat and it became a delicious side dish 👍🏼😉</p>
