        <p>When I was a kid I refused to get out of the bed if there was no smell of pancakes on Sundays 😋 as a grown up I can't afford having pancakes every Sunday but once in a while this awesome smell and taste brighten my day and motivate for a good workout! 💪🏼 the recipe is very simple: mix 1 egg, 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of milk. Add salt and sugar to your taste. Make pancakes on frying pan greased with butter. Blend bananas🍌, apple🍎, desiccated coconut, and low fat yogurt - add the mix to your pancakes with fruits of your choice 🍓</p>
