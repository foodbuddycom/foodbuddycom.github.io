        <p>Couscous! Very delicious and low calories meal, however, its Glycemic Index (GI) is too high (meaning it will supply glucose too fast to your blood, where 100% is what raw glucose injection does) and the fact that couscous is not a wholegrain (thus not too rich in fiber), makes the picture complete. Does it mean we should avoid it? Not really. It's worth having it before anaerobic workout (like I did before my 10k fast finish run), it will be a perfect fuel 💪🏼 OR, if you don't plan to workout, have a drink 🍷 before you eat😀. Studies shown that alcohol helps bring blood GI level down by 15% 😉👍🏼</p>
