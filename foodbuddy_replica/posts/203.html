        <p>Hey hey! This is a #protakeover by @azeanic - @waaultra runner 🏃🏾‍♂️
I’m finishing my racing season which has been quite active:
Ultra-Trail Tai Mo Shan (TTF-115km) 
Sundown Marathon (42km) 
Cameron Ultra (100km)
The Most Beautiful Thing (109km) 
Force of Nature Marathon (23km)
Here on @foodbuddy page I want to share with you how I fuel my trainings and ultra races. 
I generally eat most things but not pork (religious dietary requirement). Asian food on weekdays, but occasional Western and Japanese when I feel like it. 
When I'm travelling, I tend to eat foods that are quite familiar/simple to avoid stomach upsets. Like pizza 🍕 , pasta 🍝 , etc. 
Training nutrition is quite interesting. I don't eat much breakfast in the morning, maybe a small sandwich 🥪 and coffee ☕️ , then I sustain the day with Tailwind, Nut butter - @justins is my favourite one 👌🏼 and gels. 
My race day meal is usually a cup of instant noodles 🍜 and maybe a cup of coffee. It's been a routine since some years back because I would be travelling to places like France and it's quite hard to get Asian food there. 
Recovery. For a normal training routine, it's just normal food and a glass of soya milk. But when I'm racing, a sachet of Tailwind Rebuild (Chocolate), which is like a protein shake. And food of course. 🙂 
On pictures you see my favourite daily food selection: laksa, fish curry and rice, mee rebus and fried fish, rice and soup!
