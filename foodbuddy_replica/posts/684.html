        <p>Overnight porridge: buckwheat, rolled oats, chia with berries and low fat yogurt. The nutrition value is per 1 plate made of 3 tbsp of soaked buckwheat, 2 tbsp of soaked oats, 1 tbsp of soaked chia, 1/4 cup of low fat yogurt and berries. I'm sure guys looking at this post are like "hey, that's not enough for breakfast!" And you are right! 1 plate wasn't enough for @foodbuddy "chief of athletic division" either 😬 had to make him second plate and add prunes. Ladies, most likely you'll be fine 😉 -------
