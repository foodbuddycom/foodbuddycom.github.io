        <p>This morning has a special smell ☺️ of oatmeal-banana-honey-cinnamon muffins 😋 they are flourless and have no oil - so won't jeopardize your diet 👍🏼 here's recipe: roast 2.5 cups of rolled oats in oven at 180C/356F for 6-10 min (stir occasionally). Blend 1.5 cup of roasted oats into flour-like consistency, mix them with remaining 1 cup of roasted rolled oats, 2 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 tsp of soda, 1/2 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of cinnamon - mix. Blend 3 ripe bananas, add lightly bitten 2 eggs, 1 BIG tbsp of honey and mix all well. Mix dry ingredients with liquid, fill muffin tin and bake for 20 min. Enjoy! 😉
