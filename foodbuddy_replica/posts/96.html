        <p>Are you a salad person ðŸ¥—ðŸ˜Š? Meaning can you eat a big bowl of salad and be happy with this, consider it as your proper meal ðŸ¤”? We know for sure that some people canâ€™t feel satiety if they eat just a salad without any hot meal ðŸ¥˜ . 

We love salads. On a regular day without major workouts weâ€™d be ok with a big bowl of salad and piece of homemade bread but I guess itâ€™s because usually the salad that we make is quite filling - in addition to veggies and greens it has seeds, halloumi cheese and/or grains. 
Whatâ€™s your favourite salad? And whatâ€™s the worst youâ€™ve ever tried ðŸ¤­ðŸ˜„?
