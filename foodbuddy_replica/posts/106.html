        <p>Where do you find inspiration? And how do you inspire others? Besides all great stories of courage, resilience, mercy and so on, for us itâ€™s very inspiring to see how elderly people are making efforts to live active and healthy life: eating well, exercising, making friends with all generations (not only theirs), staying curious and living with an open mind. We admire our friends in their 70s and 80s who are still kicking ass and teaching us with their great example ðŸ˜Š.
