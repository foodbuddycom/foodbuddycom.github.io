        <p>Absolutely delicious vegetable meal - zucchini noodles with mushrooms, shallots, garlic, soya sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil and salt 👌🏼👍🏼 see the cooking process in the story ☝🏼nutrition info is for huge pan with 4 zucchini, mushrooms and onions. Zucchini is great if you are very cautious about your weight. Due to its high water percentage, zucchini is low in calories, carbs and sugars, but high in essential nutrients like potassium, manganese, and antioxidants like vitamin C and vitamin A! 👍🏼
