        <p>Today for dinner meat, mushroom and potato pie 🥧😋 and a thriller - Escape Room 😱! Have you guys seen this movie? Please share your list of quarantine movies 🎞 and recipes too 😉 
Here’s the pie 🥧 recipe: 
INGREDIENTS - Shortcrust Pastry Block
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 garlic clove finely diced
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 750g minced beef
- 200g mushrooms - 2 tbsp plain flour
- 300 ml beef stock
- 2-3 tbsp tomato puree
- 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into small dice, - 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- salt and pepper - Egg, beaten to glaze

METHOD
1️⃣ sauté onion, garlic in a large pan with vegetable oil, add mushrooms and beef, cook until brown, add flour, cook for 2-3 min, add stock and tomato purée, potatoes and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to boil and then simmer until potatoes are cooked. Add salt and pepper. 
2️⃣ preheat oven to 200 C / 350 F
3️⃣ Roll out half the pastry and use to line a pie dish allowing any excess to hang over edges. Place the cooled meat mixture in the dish and spread evenly over the pastry.
4️⃣ Roll out remaining pastry large enough to cover the pie, and brush borders with beaten egg. Add the pie lid to the base pressing edges firmly together all round. Trim off edges with a knife. 
5️⃣ Make a small hole in the top of the pie to allow the steam to escape. 6️⃣ Brush top with beaten egg and bake for 30 minutes or until pastry is golden brown.
7️⃣ enjoy your pie, it’s great either hot or cold! 😋🥧👌🏼 __
