        <p>If you haven't tried to add buckwheat to your salad yet strongly recommend to do so 👍🏼 this Super-food is not only gluten free, it's also very rich in minerals and various antioxidants! Also buckwheat is great source of carbs (20% of the weight of boiled groats are carbs), it scores low-to-medium GI (glycogen lasts longer) which is good for your diet. 💪🏼This salad is quite simple: finely chop broccoli florets (1 cup), 1 red onion, 1 cucumber, 1 yellow bell pepper, add cooked buckwheat, green peas (fresh or frozen), oregano leaves (add mint if you have) 🍃 2 tbsp of white wine vinegar, 1 tbsp of olive oil, salt to your taste 👍🏼 😊</p>
