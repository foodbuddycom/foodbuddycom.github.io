        <p>Plant based lunch idea - super light, easy and delicious - hit in our family after all the Christmas festivities 🤪 and before New Year’s Eve 🤤 
On the plate: 
- Sautéed mushrooms (we have mix of  bunashimeji mushrooms) 
- zucchini pasta (just slice zucchini thinly and stir fry with favourite seasoning, ours was sesame oil and sesame seeds, dash of soya sauce and garlic)
- soba noodles 
- lentils with carrots and onion 

In the bowl:
Fresh salad made of cherry tomatoes, cucumber, spinach, pea shoots, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, chickpeas (garbanzo beans), black olives, halloumi cheese, olive oil, salt and pepper 👌🏼
