        <p>Good morning! Or good evening depending where you are 😊 Today we are starting the first day of official lockdown in Singapore aka Circuit Breaker that will last till May 4th... we start it with our usual yummy breakfast: oatmeal, chia and flax seeds porridge with fruits and nuts, so it doesn’t feel different from any other day... yet 😉 we really hope situation will improve and the Government won’t have to tell us “May the force be with you for additional month(s) of lockdown” 😬 .. but observing people’s behaviour for the past few days and how number of cases sky rocketed during last week, we are ready for anything
Seriously, panic buying is no longer a groceries issue, it’s spread on IKEA, sport equipment shops and even Chanel boutique stores 😄 I wish people all over the world had that kind of problems. Cafes were pretty full because a lot of people decided to go out for “just last one meal”. Unfortunately this problem (as many others in this world) feels fictional until it really impacts us personally or someone you know. 
What’s for us? We definitely feel stressed but we count our blessings every day and this keeps us happy and grounded: we are healthy, we can still go out for essential needs - to buy groceries, buy food for takeaway, exercise in parks, sun is shining and we have probably one in a lifetime opportunity to spend so much time together with our family. 
What keeps you going these days guys? —
