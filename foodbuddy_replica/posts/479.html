        <p>This picture was taken at the end of the world’s longest jetty in Busselton, Western Australia. It’s good to know which direction to swim to get to one of the best cities in the world, but Even better to know that the jetty is surrounded by sharks 🦈 😬 and better not even try or tri 😉 (swim was cancelled this year at #Ironmanwa if you remember) Where do you guys travel this Christmas? 🎄🎅🏼🎁 My office today was like a ghost city - empty... half of the people are gone for Christmas break already!
