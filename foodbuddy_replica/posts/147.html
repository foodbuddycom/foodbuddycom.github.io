COOKING METHOD
1️⃣ mix all dough ingredients and make a dough. Set it aside 
2️⃣ thinly slice (~1/2 cm or 1/5 inch) zucchini and red onion. Mix them with 2 tbsp of olive oil and place on a baking sheet (spread evenly so they don’t cover each other) and season with salt (to your taste). Bake zucchini and onions for 25-30 min on 220 C / 430 F, toss them half way through. Once cooked, set them aside to cool down 
3️⃣ drizzle dough with 1 tbsp of olive oil, spread it on baking sheet and season with salt 🧂 bake at the lower rack for ~10 min until it’s crispy and brown 
4️⃣ while baking your flatbread, mix ricotta, parmesan cheese, 2 tbsp of olive oil, 1/2 tsp of salt, grate zest of half of the lemon (use microplane) and mince or grate the garlic clove and mix it with ricotta mix. 
5️⃣ spread all your ricotta mix over flatbread and top it with baked zucchini and onion. Put back to the oven and bake for another 6-8 min. 
6️⃣ take out your flatbread and sprinkle the zest of second half of the lemon, drizzle the left over of your olive oil (add more if needed), sprinkle chilli or red pepper flakes and add basil leaves. 
7️⃣ enjoy! 😉
