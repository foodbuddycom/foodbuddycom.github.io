        <p>One of the challenges that we are all facing now is how not to gain weight while on #COVID19 lockdown. Exercise options are so limited and news everyday are so disappointing that it immediately wants to eat chocolate or even two and drink some wine (at best) üò¨ü§≠
Aghrr...2020 turned out to be very annoying BUT this too shall pass! Let‚Äôs try to do our best now:
ü§∏üèª find ways how to exercise at home (luckily there are so many apps and video content with exercises on YouTube) ü•ó and take good control over our food consumption. We definitely don‚Äôt need as much food as we usually eat, because most likely we aren‚Äôt able to burn the usual amount of calories while on lockdown. 
This week we will be sharing different meals that are calorie light yet filling, healthy snacks and food that can help you manage your stress. Stay tuned and save this recipe üòâ
