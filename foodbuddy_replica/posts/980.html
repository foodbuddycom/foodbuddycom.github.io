        <p>This is for those who just woke up in the western part of the world🌖 and rest of us 🌘who scratching head and thinking what to eat for breakfast tomorrow 🤔 eat fruits & nuts and soaked oats of course! 😉 I hope you love papaya like I do, because it's extremely rich in vitamins! Papaya is one of the fruits with the highest concentration of vitamin C per serving, beta-carotene and potassium 👍🏼💪🏼👌🏼</p>
