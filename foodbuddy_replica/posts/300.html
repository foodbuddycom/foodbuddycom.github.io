        <p>I was preparing for #Pongyaengtrail 100 mi race all of this year (remember those crazy running posts?), even traveled to Chiang Mai in April for holiday to check out the trails. All of these efforts payed off - yesterday I finished my 100 mi trail race 2nd ü•à! It was a 29 hr long race for me - awesome and insane at the same time! With lots of rains in the forest and 8 km elevation... While I‚Äôm preparing the full review of the race, here are few key takeaways that I would love to share with you guys: 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Double socks. Injini inner, Drymax outer. Take extra and  change them as they get wet.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Use sugar-coated fruit slices as alternative food source. Dry mango. Fiber fills you up as lingers in stomach.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Take it really easy and split distance in descending order, and don‚Äôt check your watch too often. Just go!.. 60-40-30-20-10-6 or so.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Have protein. Dialy diet of a healthy human is 15% protein. A 24h or more event is still a day in life, plus you destroy your muscles. Hence, don‚Äôt skip on your protein supply. NuZest Clean Lean Protein bar saved me during the race.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Aid stations in Thailand are dreams came true. Guava, mandarines, ‚Äî anything rich in Vitamin C. Have to FORCE yourself eat it. Mind that there are some side-effects if you haven‚Äôt eaten fruits on the go before. Not as easy as slicing gel. Maybe next time I‚Äôd try pure Vitamin C.
Good luck to anyone who is preparing for trail races ‚Äî
