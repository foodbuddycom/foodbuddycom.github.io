        <p>Sure thing you guys like quinoa! 😍 it's the best Superfood🏅 an athlete can get: ideal for endurance as it is a complete protein (similar to milk or prawns) - has all 9 essential amino acids that help our bodies to build lean muscles💪🏼 and recover faster from tough workouts🏊🏼🚴🏼🏃🏼. On top of this, quinoa is a great source of carbs, fiber, manganese, magnesium, iron, zinc, potassium and calcium. 👍🏼 This quinoa salad is very easy to make: mix cooked quinoa (ready in 15 min), blanched broccoli, cucumber, avocado and peas, add on some feta cheese and olive oil, salt and pepper for savoury taste and enjoy your meal 🤗</p>
