        <p>How was weekend guys? Let’s be honest how many sinful snacks have you munched while watching favourite show or enjoying time with your best people 😉? Didn’t want to make you feel guilty (well, maybe just a bit 😜), instead let us share with you an AWESOME HEALTHY SNACK recipe: baked chickpeas with ranch seasoning 👌🏼🤤 just 20 min end-to-end cooking! 
INGREDIENTS: - 2 cans of cooked chickpeas, drained and thoroughly dried - 1/3 cup of olive oil
- ranch seasoning. If you don’t have one, here’s how you can make your own: - 2 tablespoons dried parsley
- 2 teaspoons dried dill
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 2 teaspoons dried onion flakes
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried chives
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/3 cup buttermilk powder
- blend well all ingredients together in a food processor 
RECIPE: - place chickpeas on a baking sheet (evenly spread in 1 layer) and bake for 30 min at 205C/400F until they are golden and crispy - take them out of oven, place in a big bowl, add olive oil and ranch seasoning, mix well
- put coated chickpeas back to baking sheet and bake for another 10 min.
ENJOY! 🤗 —
