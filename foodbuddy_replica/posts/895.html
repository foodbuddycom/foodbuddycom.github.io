        <p>If you wanna get high - casserole is what you buy 😄 🍲 😉 veggies steamed in casserole (cauldron) always taste so great and are beneficial for your health (high content of fiber and volume of veggies help control  digestion and hunger level). Veggies in casserole are cooked in their own juice and very fast (15-20 min) because casserole evenly distributes the thermal power from the cooker through its thick walls 👍🏼 here you can see the following recipe: 1 tbsp of olive oil (optional), 1 red onion, 4 garlic cloves, 2 medium red chillies 🌶, 4 medium potatoes, 2 big egg plants 🍆, 1 carrot, bunch of lady fingers (okra) and long red and yellow bell peppers,  mushrooms, tomato 🍅, broccoli, 1/2 cup of water (if needed or want more juice), 1 tsp of salt, herbs 🌿 : parsley, basil, rosemary, thyme, cumin - very filling and delicious!</p>
