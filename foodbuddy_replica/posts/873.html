        <p>This is absolutely delicious mushroom chicken soup🍲👌🏼☺️ must try, especially during cold late October days. Cook chicken breast broth, remove chicken and let it cool and cut into cubes. In the meanwhile sauté 3 types of mushroom (combination of different mushrooms give better taste), onion, green beans with 1 tbsp of olive oil (add salt, pepper, herbs and spices to you taste). Add potato and chicken cubes to the boiling chicken broth, wait until almost cooked and then add mushrooms, simmer 5 more min. Add cilantro and Chilli 🌶  flakes if you like it spicy. Enjoy healthy meal - mushrooms have rich nutrient profile and very beneficial for your health 👍🏼</p>
