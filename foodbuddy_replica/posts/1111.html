        <p>Happy Friday everyone! 🙃 having crispy Chia with blueberries, almonds, cinnamon,  and maple syrup this morning! 👍🏼 1/2 cup of Chia seeds  mixed with 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of water - bring it to boil and simmer on low heat until most of the liquid is absorbed (will take not more than 10 min) add blueberries (or any other berries), 1 tea spoon of cinnamon and 1 tea spoon of maple syrup - ENJOY!!! 😉</p>
