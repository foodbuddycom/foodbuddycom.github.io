        <p>One of us complained today: breakfast is the same😏... Another one started thinking whether it is good or bad? 😯It's actually good to eat what you've got used to eat especially before the race👌🏼 (you don't want to have an unexpected surprise 😳, do you?) and it's good to have this particular breakfast as it's quite balanced: a good portion of fruits, nuts, oatmeal and low fat yoghurt ✔️ at the same time variety is important! The regular posts about breakfasts with chia seeds in our timeline inspired us to go and buy this Super food today 😉 will show the results tomorrow! 😊 any recommendations?</p>
