        <p>TA-DAAA!!! Welcome our first Chia breakfast! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Chia- mango pudding with raw macadamia nuts and pumpkin seeds so delicious 👌🏼 and easy to make! We just blended mango, mixed Chia seeds with milk and blended prunes, let Chia seeds to soak in milk for 5 min and added to mango puree. It stayed overnight in the fridge and was damn perfect in the morning 👍🏼 worth your money and effort for sure!</p>
