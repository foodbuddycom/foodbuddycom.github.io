        <p>It's hard to resist the great variety of fresh meat in New Zealand, so it's a lean meat festive today - grilled beef and lamb loin with potato and salad 😋👌🏼 When selecting the meat for your meals try to stick to round and loin parts as they contain less fat and cholesterol. Avoid frying and adding sauces ⛔️ better use herbs such as rosemary, sage, basil, thyme, to improve the taste of the meat 👍🏼</p>
