        <p>Power breakfast for 2 anyone? ✌🏼️😉Rolled oats (soaked in hot water) topped up with low fat yogurt, fruits (banana, kiwi, mango) and nuts (walnuts and Brazil nuts). This breakfast helps last till very late lunch 👍🏼 🕑 complex carbs from rolled oats, protein from yogurt, fiber, vitamins, micro elements and sugar from fruits, good fats from nuts - this is probably all you could wish for... Well it can't beat morning coffee though 😄☕️❤️</p>
