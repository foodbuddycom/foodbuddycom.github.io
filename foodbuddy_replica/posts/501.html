        <p>Cheat meal day 😬 had a working lunch today and couldn’t find anything that I like on the menu, so decided to try highly recommended pasta with mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and peas. It was delicious and generous serving (super oily though). But what’s interesting the satiety lasted barely 2 hours 😕 what a waste of all these calories!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️ If I had a meal with the same caloric value but made of complex carbs (high in fiber) I would be running like Speedy Gonzalez for the rest of the day 😄 this is all because refined grains have little to no fiber, hence there’s NO bulk that should linger in your stomach and provide feeling of satiety during longer period of time. Make healthy choices and don’t cheat with your food people 😉
