        <p>It has been active lately 😅 with Arseny’s preparation for 100 miles trail run in mid-November and 2 month old future triathlete with great appetite at home, both of us need a good healthy stack that can boost our energy level and keep us going in between meals. This peanut butter-fruit sandwich with homemade wholemeal bread is exactly what both of us need and if you are, like us - running 100+ km per week or breastfeeding a newborn 🏃🏻‍♂️🤱🏻😅 - definitely should try it. It’s easy to make and very delicious 👌🏼 watch out IGTV for step-by-step process 😉
