        <p>Do not underestimate the importance of recovery meal, especially if you train every day🏊🏼🚴🏼🏃🏼🏋🏼. During training, muscle proteins are broken down, and glycogen (carbohydrate) stores and electrolyte levels are reduced⬇️. Recovery meal helps repair muscles and improve future performance💪🏼. Most importantly, only the right kind of food in the right amount can lead to the optimal recovery☝🏼: 1.2 g of carbs per kg of weight (quinoa🍲), 1 g  of high quality protein (chicken🍗) for every 4 g of carbs and 1.5L of fluid💦 (consumed gradually) for every 1kg body mass lost during exercise.</p>
