        <p>Subway veggie wrap with mustard always saves the diet when you need to eat on the go. As we recently mention on our Twitter @foodbuddyapp, non-sweeten mustard is really good for Athletes especially male Athletes. It's only 27 cal/100 gram and prevent prostate cancer 👍🏼 and don't forget to grab some fruits and fresh juice from the nearest stall 🍎😉🍏</p>
