        <p>About last weekend: just an ordinary Russian breakfast, people 🤷🏻‍♀️joking of course 😋 crepes are rare delicacy these days, especially with red caviar, however, when we were kids this is how every weekend morning used to start. We refused to get out of bed if there’s no smell of crepes in the house 😄 crepes with homemade jams: strawberry, raspberry, cherry, black currant, apricot (oh my! So many jams made by my mom!) or condensed milk, sour-cream, stuffed with minced beef or with cottage cheese - there is endless variety of them. Do you like crepes? How do you like to eat them?
