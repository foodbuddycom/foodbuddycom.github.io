        <p>For Athletes who want to perform at peak levels 🏊🏼🚴🏼🏃🏼🏅 Salmon is a must have superfood🐟💪🏼😊. There are plenty of reasons for this:
1. Salmon contains higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids than most seafood species. Endurance athletes need omega-3s to reduce inflammation at the cellular level, which can also help lessen pain 😩and soreness😖 caused by inflammation. Omega-3s from marine sources are easily absorbed and used by the body, hence more beneficial. In contrast, only 10-15% of plant omega-3 fatty acids are converted and used in the body☝🏼️. 2. It is a great source of lean, high-quality protein that is easily digested and it is low in saturated fat - good for heart ❤️and mussels recovery💪🏼
3. Salmon is high in vitamin D which is essential for strength and health of our bones☠. It also supports immune system and acts as an antioxidant to reduce free radicals at the cellular level that are produced from endurance training. 
4. It contains B vitamins. B6 and B12 help us break down food for energy to be used to fuel training and performance and they also support bones. Also B12 is good for aerobic energy metabolism as it helps with oxygen transport. 
To get the balanced meal - eat salmon with green salad, vegetables and whole grains 👍🏼</p>
