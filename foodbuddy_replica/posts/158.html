        <p>Was craving for some plant based comfort food and decided to cook this eggplant kuku 🍆- Iranian version of Italian frittata and French quiche. I used @ottolenghi recipe from his famous Plenty More and it was very delicious (as usual with all Ottolenghi’s recipes) and super fast (which is unusual haha 😜) Dried barberries in this dish give really nice and fresh sourness 😋 if you like many of us stuck in your hometowns, all travels are cancelled and you don’t really want to go and eat out - you should definitely cook this dish to complement your evening shows on Netflix 😉 stay safe, wash your hands ✌🏼 INGREDIENTS: 
120ml sunflower oil, plus extra
3 medium onions, peeled and sliced
3 medium aubergines, peeled
5 free-range eggs
2 tbsp plain flour
1½ tsp baking powder
25g chopped parsley, plus extra to garnish
1 tsp saffron strands, dissolved in 1 tbsp of hot water
3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
½ tsp salt
Black pepper
20g dried barberries, rinsed and dried
RECIPE:
1️⃣ Heat the oil in a large, heavy pan and sauté the onions over medium heat for 7 minutes, until soft
2️⃣ cut the 🍆 in two widthways, cut each half into 1cm-thick slices, then cut each slice into 1cm-thick strips. Add these to the onion pan and cook on medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, for around 10 minutes, until the 🍆 are completely soft
3️⃣ In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, flour, baking powder, parsley, the saffron and its water, garlic, salt and a good grind of pepper. Once smooth, fold in the barberries and the aubergine and onion mix
4️⃣ Brush a 22cm spring-form cake tin with plenty of oil, line with greaseproof paper and brush the paper with more oil. Pour the egg mix into the tin and bake for 30-40 minutes, until golden-brown and cooked through – insert a skewer in the middle to make sure the egg has set
