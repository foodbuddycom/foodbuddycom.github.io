        <p>HOMEMADE DIPS and yummy sourdough bread were the highlight of this weekend. I cooked something new this Saturday - 2 dips from @ottolenghi - Baigan Choka, the Trinidadian eggplant dip (middle) and yogurt and kaffir lime leaf spread (left) and homemade hummus (right)- all time favourite! ðŸ˜‹ the result was great (checked on friends and family) I encourage you to try! These all tasted especially good to Arseny after his 46 km run ðŸ˜„
What is your favourite dip?
