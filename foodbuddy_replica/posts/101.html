        <p>We absolutely LOVE this BEET, AVOCADO, and PEA SALAD from @ottolenghi ‚Äòs Plenty More. Never thought that avocados and beets taste so good together! Well, Ottolenghi is the MASTER of surprising combinations and amazing tastes ü§§ you should try it too üòä
INGREDIENTS: 
‚ûñ4 medium raw beetroots ( 350g-400g) pealed and cut into paper-thin slices
‚ûñ1 small red onion, thinly sliced
‚ûñ3 tbsp sherry vinegar
‚ûñ4 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra to finish
‚ûñ¬Ω tsp caster sugar
‚ûñ1-3 tsp savoury chilli sauce or paste (Tabasco or Mexican Cholula hot sauce)
‚ûñ1 tsp salt
‚ûñFreshly ground black pepper
‚ûñ2 medium avocados, peeled and thinly sliced
‚ûñ10g coriander leaves
‚ûñ10g mint leaves
‚ûñ20g pea shoots (or mache) 
‚ûñ150g fresh or frozen green peas, quickly blanched and refreshed

COOKING METHOD:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Put the beetroot in a pot with plenty of boiling water and simmer for three to five minutes, until semi-cooked; it should still be crunchy. Drain and put in a large bowl.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add the red onion, vinegar, oil, sugar, chilli sauce, salt and pepper to the beetroot bowl and toss everything together gently ‚Äì your hands are the best tool for this. Leave to one side for 10-15 minutes.
3Ô∏è‚É£ When you're ready to serve, spread half the beetroot mixture on a large platter or in a shallow bowl. Top with half the avocado, coriander, mint, pea shoots and broad beans. Add the rest of the beetroot and arrange the remaining ingredients on top. Drizzle with a little oil and serve.
