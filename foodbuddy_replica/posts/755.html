        <p>One of @foodbuddy 's favourite healthy snacks - edamame beans 👌🏼🤤 these delicious beans have very good content of carbs, fiber and protein 👍🏼 quite low in sugar and calories ☝🏼 Edamame are good for your bones as they contain calcium, phosphorous, iron💪🏼. Good for your skin as they rich in vitamin E and C - strong antioxidants 💁. And guess what! Edamame beans contain more potassium than bananas 🍌</p>
