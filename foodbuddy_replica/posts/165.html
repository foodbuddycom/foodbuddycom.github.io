        <p>Arseny and I just finished lengthy discussion about sarcasm, and how it can improve or spoil communications in personal and professional life. While Arseny just generally banters a lot more than needed, with a poker face (...you all know it), I don’t believe he mastered the artful skill of sarcasm just yet! And as to me... Sarcasm for me is like this breakfast: fruits on top were sweet and juicy 😋 but the yogurt beneath the fruits, that I mixed with rolled oats, flax, hemp, chia seeds, was too sour 😏 and kind of spoiled the enjoyment. What do you guys think about sarcasm? What are good and bad examples of it? When do you tend to be too sarcastic?
