        <p>Ironman Western Australia is fast approaching me, hence trainings are more frequent and intense 🏊🏼‍♂️🚴🏼‍♂️🏃🏽‍♂️😰 my knees and back definitely don’t appreciate such stress - time to add more antioxidants to my diet to fight increased amount of free radicals and damage that they make to tissues and cells. Chia pudding with fruits and berries smoothie is one of really good antioxidants rich meals that you can have as a breakfast or a snack 👍🏼 Don’t underestimate the damaging effects of oxidation. “It can take years, even a lifetime to reveal their impact. Antioxidants should be viewed as insurance against this damage. With long-term consumption of antioxidants you will support healthy cells leading to healthy cellular respiration. If you train heavily day in and day out, antioxidants should be a staple in your training diet”
