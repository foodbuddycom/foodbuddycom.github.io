        <p>Finishing week on a spicy note 🔥 chicken curry with brown rice 🍛👌🏼 
Got an amazing curry paste (just 1 table spoon made us hiccup 😅, telling as a big spicy food lovers) that made our curry the brightest highlight of this week (this week was very positive and eventful, but this curry is still the winner!) If you’d like a recipe let us know 😉
