        <p>What was your craving lately? 
We were craving for this homemade granola all working week and finally made it this Saturday morning! 😋 

Here’s recipe from @jamieoliver for you: 
➖200 g rolled oats 
➖180 g mixed nuts 
➖150 g mixed dried fruits (raisins, cranberries, apricots etc.) 
➖ 50 g mixed seeds (poppy, sunflower, pumpkin)
➖50 g desiccated coconut 
➖1 tsp ground cinnamon 
➖5 tbsp maple syrup or runny honey 🍯 
➖ 5 tbsp olive oil 
Mix all ingredients well and bake for 30 min at 180C/350F (stirring it every 5 min) 
Once it’s ready, serve with yogurt or milk and fruits - it’s absolutely delicious 🤤
