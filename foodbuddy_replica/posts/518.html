        <p>Looking for something nourishing, hearty, yet light on a cold autumn day? Try this recipe: mixed mung beans, lentils, stir fry long beans, tomatoes, red chilli, onion and garlic, dash of sesame oil, soya sauce, salt and black pepper. This is how I felt today, no, it's not cold in Singapore, and won't be anytime soon, however offices and any transport are freezing cold inside. This dish was a spot on - loved it a lot. Checked its nutrition value on @foodbuddy food tracker and was very pleased --- #iromantri #triathlon #marathon #healthyfood #sportnutrition #swimbikerun #dietfood #orbea #cervelo #specializedbikes #giantbikes #canyonbikes #bmcbikes #boardmanbikes #ironmantraining #marathontraining #trailrun #stew #healthycarbs #veganfriendly</p>
