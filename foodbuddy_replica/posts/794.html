        <p>Bosch - a national Ukrainian soup is very delicious and beneficial for you 👌🏼☺️! There are so many recipes of Borsch but not all of them are healthy enough. This one is very simple and the healthiest you can make: prepare a chicken broth, add potatoes, once 2 potatoes are semi-cooked add grated carrots, beetroots, chopped onions, garlic, pepper, tomatoes and cabbage. Bring to boil and immediately turn off the stove. Add  parsley, dill, black pepper and let borsch stay for a 30 min. Serve to plates and add low fat yogurt if you like. Enjoy! 😊</p>
