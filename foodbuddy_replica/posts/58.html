        <p>Homemade Egg Royale 🤤 
One of our favourite brunch meals, actually so easy to make at home! 🤗 
The biggest challenge is to cook pretty poached eggs! These are not the prettiest, lesson learned - I didn’t have enough water in the pot. It is better to have at least 3/4 of the pot filled with water in order to make good whirlpool that you need to make poached eggs. Oh, and don’t forget to add vinegar to your water, 1 tbsp is enough. So, bring your water to boil, reduce the heat to medium, keep water simmering, add vinegar, crack a fresh chilled egg and pour it into a small cup, make a good whirlpool in the pot, pour egg into this whirlpool (tip: when pouring egg, place it as low and close to water as you can) and cook for 1-2 min. 
The rest is simple: slice of nice wholemeal bread (homemade is the best 👌🏼), smoked salmon, slices of avocado 🥑 salt and pepper! 

Enjoy your homemade brunch! 😉
