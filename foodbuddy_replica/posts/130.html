        <p>POWER LUNCH 💪🏼 one of simple healthy bowls that is packed with fiber, lean protein, vitamins, minerals and no empty calories 👍🏼 ➖brown rice porridge ➖baked chicken breast with herbs 🌿, zucchini, and shiitake mushrooms
➖cooked sweet corn 😋 
A bowl like this is our favourite recovery meal after training and long working day. Ingredients can vary but rule of thumb is to have some whole grains or legumes / beans, some veggies and lean meat. If you don’t eat meat, you can always replace it with plant based protein, adding more legumes, grains, leafy greens 🥬
