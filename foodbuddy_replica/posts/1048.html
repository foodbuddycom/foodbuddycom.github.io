        <p>My Saturday had 2 highlights: riding 142 k 🚴🏼💪🏼 and baking super awesome strudel 😋 the video is pretty much self explanatory but here are some valuable tips: 
Dough🌯: 300 g of flour, 3 tbs of veg oil, 1/2 tea spoon of salt. Once make it, leave it for 30 min 
Croutons🍞: bake pieces of wholemeal bread (50 g), process them in blender, then fry them for 2 min with butter. You will need them to protect dough from fruit juice ☝🏼️ Stuffing🍎🍇: mix 5 sliced medium apples with juice of 1/2 lemon, add grapes, almonds, sugar and cinnamon (to your taste) 
Bake on 180 degrees C for 45 min! 1-2 times apply butter. Enjoy</p>
