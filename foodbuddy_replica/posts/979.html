        <p>If you are crazy about french fries 🍟 try to replace them with mashed potatoes (same-same but different) ☝🏼️ A cup of homemade mashed potatoes with milk and little bit of butter will give ~ 200 Calories, 13% of daily norm of potassium, which nourishes your nerves and muscles and help maintain body's fluid balance, and will boost vitamin B6 which activates more than 100 enzymes and support metabolism 👍🏼💪🏼</p>
