        <p>Oatmeal porridge is so good for your health, however it is boring by default 😐 unless you add a spoon of chia seeds, butter, banana and mixed berries 😁🍲🍌🍒🍇🍓 if you haven't tried to add chia seeds to your porridge you'd better do so as they add two times more protein than most grains and five times more calcium than milk. Plus, they have high levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, soluble fiber, potassium and antioxidants and few calories. Not bad, right? 😉</p>
