        <p>Veggies, more veggies and barley grits - this meal is great source of fiber, you will feel satiety quite fast. Barley grits contain a special type of fiber- beta-glucan, which is especially good for cholesterol reduction, support immune system and regulate blood pressure 👍🏼 barley grits are good for breakfast and perfectly substitute corn grits or corn meal ☝🏼️stay healthy people 😉</p>
