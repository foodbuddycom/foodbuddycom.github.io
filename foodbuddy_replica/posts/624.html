        <p>It's time to upgrade! Good bye #garminforerunner920xt ✋🏼Got my new #garminforerunner935 😃 super excited! 
From obvious: it's round☝🏼😄, up and down buttons are now on left hand side which I find confusing. Sophisticated performance notifications and physiological metrics. Seamlessly detected all sensors, now you can co trip music and define hot keys. Overall impressive enhancements and optical hr sensor. Now waiting for my quick release set.
Anyone using 935? How do you like it? 🤔
