        <p>Omega-3, iron and vitamin C and A loading👊🏼. Today for dinner - baked salmon with herbs, blanched broccoli with carrot and baby spinach leaves, flax and sesame seeds. Every time you eat carrots and spinach (generally all red, orange, yellow and dark green veggies high in carotenoids), season it with oil, otherwise your body will not be able to absorb all valuable nutrients. ☝🏼️</p>
