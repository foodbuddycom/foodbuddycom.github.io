        <p>Today for breakfast - Quinoa porridge with cinnamon, banana and fig 🍲 💪🏼 one of so many reasons why quinoa is a super food is because unlike many other grains quinoa has significantly greater amounts of amino acids lysine and isoleucine (especially lysine), and these greater amounts of lysine and isoleucine allow the protein in quinoa to serve as a complete protein source☝🏼️. Why it is important to have proteins in our daily athlete diet? 🤔Proteins are made from 2️⃣1️⃣ different amino acids. While 1️⃣2️⃣ of these can be synthesized in the body from common metabolic intermediates, the remaining 9️⃣ can't be synthesized in the body, but must be provided in the diet🍲. These are called the essential or indispensable amino acids. If they are not provided in adequate amounts to meet the need for tissue protein synthesis then it is not possible to rebuild tissues from excessive training🏊🏼🚴🏼🏃🏼🏋🏼🤕. Also, it does not matter how we meet an energy requirement. There is no requirement for a dietary source of carbohydrate, fat (apart from fatty acids) or alcohol. Our bodies can synthesize as much carbohydrate as is needed from the amino acids derived from proteins. So how much protein do Athletes need?⚖ Broad agreement among experts - 1 g of protein per kg of body weight is a daily norm sufficient for most endurance Athletes. 1.6 g of protein per kg of weight is the most needed by any endurance athlete👍🏼 eat healthy and stay fit!</p>
