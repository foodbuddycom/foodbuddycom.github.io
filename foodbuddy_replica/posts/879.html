        <p>This breakfast will give you a very powerful  boost of energy and will keep you going for long 🏃🏽🏃🏽🏃🏽🏃🏽 Super-food - chia and flax seeds - soaked in low fat yogurt, topped up with dried mango - low GI long lasting source of carbs, rich in vitamin A, calcium and iron (vitamin C is lost in dried mangos), Brazil nuts - the richest known source of selenium - an essential micromineral and antioxidant used by your body to prevent free radical oxidative damage to your cells. Also Brazil nuts are good for cortisol regulation as it is rich in magnesium (98% RDA) which calms your nervous system and prevents the creation of excess cortisol, the stress hormone. And a dash of Manuka honey 🍯 which nutritional content is up to 4 times that of normal flower honey (amino acids, group of vitamin B, calcium, potassium, copper, iron, magnesium, manages, phosphorus, zinc, sodium) 💪🏼👍🏼 have a great weekend!!! 😊</p>
