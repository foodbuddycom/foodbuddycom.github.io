        <p>No.1 reason why I love Saturdays is that I can wake up very late and enjoy my breakfast without any rush 🍲😋 (unless I wake up at 4.30 am for around the island ride 😁) 2 hard boiled eggs with mix of spinach  leaves 🍃, tomatoes🍅, mushrooms, onion and pumpkin seeds - great breakfast below 200 Calories rich in lean protein, iron, zinc, electrolytes, vitamin A, C, D and many more. Eat healthy and have a great weekend ahead! 👋🏼😉</p>
