        <p>What gives you great energy boost? I’m a coffee addict but don’t feel myself good if I drink more than 2 cups of coffee per day. So by 4 pm I find myself deflated and in search for some energy boosters except coffee. Recently I start making ginger matcha tea with lemon and honey and it became a game changer for me 💪🏼Not only it recharges me super-fast, it also very beneficial for my health: 
🍋 Vitamin C and antioxidants in lemon and green tea (matcha powder) are great support for my immunity, 
🍵 ginger is good for our digestion (helps deal with bloating), it also can reduce muscle pain and soreness. 
🍯 honey is a nature’s candy! 😋
This drink is great cold and hot. Living in Singapore I enjoy cold one 😅 
I think you should definitely try it just bear in mind that you may want to adjust amount of each ingredient based on your preferences.
