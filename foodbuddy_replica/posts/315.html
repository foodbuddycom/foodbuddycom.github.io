        <p>Discount code for 20% off a really tasty protein powder — read below ⬇️ We knew if we didn't write this phrase you wouldn't read 😜

Preparing for 100 miles (166 km) trail run, with 9,000+ meters total elevation (more than Mt.Everest) is definitely not a joke for Arseny! His 'Simulator' was a stagerred goal of 100 km in 24 hours, and he done it last week. You guys probably seen his sad face, huh! Proper recovery nutrition is of extreme importance, — Arseny needs to avoid any injuries between long runs in his volume of training, right until the taper week. The race is 1 month away, he can't risk it! 
Here’s one of the best smoothies that I made for him after a 22 km training. It has everything a runner needs to reduce the muscle damage, speed up the tissues repair, supply anti-oxidands to fight off remaining free radicals, and to support bones and knee joints!
- Bananas 🍌 and kiwi 🥝 are loaded with potassium
- Kiwi 🥝 and lemon 🍋 are great source of vitamin C and antioxidants
- Spinach 🍃packed with iron that we (athletes) keep losing with sweat during intensive trainings
- Mint 🌱 great anti-inflammatory herb - Matcha green tea powder 🍵 - one of the most powerful antioxidants
- Low fat yogurt - rich in calcium and phosphorus and protein

Coolest thing is that @nuzest_singapore shared with us was Clean Lean Protein, that contains all nine (9!!!) essential amino acids (read "protein") and is made from premium-quality golden peas. This plant-based protein supplement will be essential for Arseny's trainings and recovery. Tested this morning, it brought him back to working mode extremely fast 💪🏼 🏃🏽. And yes, it also has great vanilla taste 😄👍🏼 Regardless whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, or a meat-lover, — if you are looking for an AWESOME protein source - look no further

So! We agreed with @nuzest_singapore and asked them (...in exchange to supplying us with their powder for the whole next month, ha-ha! Expect more recipes!) — to give all y'all a discount code! They generated a 72 hr code for "Clean Lean Protein", use promotion  FOODBUDDY
