        <p>Eggplant 🍆- our most favourite vegetable! When it’s cooked following one of the recipes of genius @ottolenghi it’s simply mind blowing 🤤 Eggplant Pahi - “Sri Lankan kind-of-chutney” not so healthy but absolutely scrumptious dish you should definitely try 👌🏼 comes really well with quinoa, rice, and roasted beef! Feeling blessed that we live in Southeast Asia and it’s really easy to find all the spices and herbs required for this recipe, which can be easily find online, otherwise I guess it would be a treasure hunt 😅.
