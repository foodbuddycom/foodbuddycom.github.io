        <p>When do guys usually eat a salad? Before or after a main course? I usually eat before but today ate after and started thinking - is there a right way to eat salad?🤔🥗🧐 searched in the web, obviously found tons of articles and blog posts supporting both ways, however I would agree with the research paper published by Department of Nutritional Sciences, The Pennsylvania State Universit “Salad and satiety. The effect of timing of salad consumption on meal energy intake”. It doesn’t really matter when you eat a low-energy-dense salad as long as it is compulsory ☝🏼Compulsory salad reduced meal energy intake by 11% regardless of when it was eaten. Maximizing salad intake was an effective strategy for reducing meal energy intake.😉 #iromantri #triathlon #marathon #healthyfood #sportnutrition #swimbikerun #dietfood #orbea #cervelo #specializedbikes #giantbikes #canyonbikes #bmcbikes #boardmanbikes #ironmantraining #marathontraining #trailrun #salad</p>
