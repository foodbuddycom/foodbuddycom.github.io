        <p>Hi there everyone I am Abi @abi_ultra_runner, everything that I do is always 100% and then some. I am always looking for challenges that everyone fears. Ultra running 🏃🏾‍♂️is one of them 😉
Throughout my journey I have tried many types of diets: keto, high-carb, low carb, high-protein, etc. But I realised quickly that these diets were good for a period only but could not be maintained as a lifestyle.
My current diet is something that I can maintain day in day out easily without comprising my training or racing performances. 
I have adopted the following strategy for a couple of years now and it has worked very well for me. Let me share it with you: 
1️⃣ I view food as a source of fuel to meet the training demands that I put on my body. So my daily intake of meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner are the same. In between breakfast, lunch, and dinner I do take a plant-based protein shake as a supplement. This approach gives me consistency in how I feel and in my performance. 
2️⃣ I train very early in the morning and do it on a fasted state. However, if I am doing tempo and steady-state runs then I will have my fitness-drink during these runs. This drink contains both simple and complex carbohydrates that meet the demands of such high intensity trainings.
3️⃣ I do my weekend long runs on a fasted state as well and every 90 to 120min I eat gels.
4️⃣ I do not change my food when I prepare for an event and my training load increases. I just increase the quantity of certain types of food, such as quinoa, sweet potatoes, olive oil, cheese, and kales to meet the increase in the training load. In this way it’s much easier to manage.
5️⃣ I pay a huge amount of attention to what my body tells me. For example, muscle twitching, sore muscles, and poor sleep quality. These signals are important for me as there are telling me that I am not recovering well after a hard session of training. Which translates that I may not be consuming enough quality food for recovery. 
🏃🏾‍♂️🏃🏾‍♂️🏃🏾‍♂️
Tomorrow I’ll tell you more about my approach to supplements. Stay tuned and ask your questions in comments 😁</p>
