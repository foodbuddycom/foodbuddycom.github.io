        <p>My favourite veggie stew with black beans - yumm!!! 😋 No group has a more health-supportive mix of protein-plus-fiber than legumes and black beans are not an exclusion. From a single, one-cup serving of black beans you get nearly 15 g of fiber, >50% of daily norm, and 15 g of protein, ~33% of daily norm, and equivalent to the amount in 2 ounces of a meat like chicken🐓 or a fish like salmon🐟. Do you know any fruit, vegetable, grain, meat, nut or seed with such protein-fiber combination?🤔 Because of this great protein-fiber combination legumes are so beneficial for our digestive tract, the blood sugar regulatory system, and the cardiovascular system. 💪🏼👍🏼</p>
