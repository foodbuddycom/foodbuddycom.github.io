        <p>I strongly believe that scarcity of resources boosts creativity. Today I had only 1 type of vegetable in my fridge - big cucumber 😄 it turned out that stir fried chicken with cucumber is super delicious!!! 👌🏼☺️ here's recipe, make sure you try it:
0.5 kg chicken breast (cut into cubes and set aside) 
0.5 kg of cucumber (remove seeds, cut into cubes and dry with kitchen towel )
Heat the wok or deep frying pan, add 1 tbsp of peanut oil (or oil of your choice) and chicken cubes and stir fry for 1 min. 
Add 1.5 tbsp of garlic, 2 tbsp of green onion, 2 tsp of sesame oil, 2 tsp of chilli powder, 1 tbsp of soya sauce, white (rice) vinegar, and salt to your taste - stir fry for another 5-7 min 
Add cucumber cubes and stir fry another 3-4 min! 
Add your favourite garnish - quinoa for example 😉 enjoy!!!</p>
