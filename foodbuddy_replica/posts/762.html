        <p>Athlete's dinner from #mattfitzgerald - Salmon burger with sweet potato wedges and spinach salad. Original recipe: "
Chop up the salmon and add it to a bowl containing the chopped red onion, basil, salt, pepper, and hot pepper sauce. Mix everything together, add the egg white to the bowl and stir thoroughly. Shape the salmon mixture into four equal-size patties and cook them in a frying pan with a little oil over medium heat for 3 minutes per side. Serve each on a lightly toasted bun. You can’t very well serve such a fancy burger with regular french fries. It has to be sweet potato fries—preferably home cooked. They’re easy: Combine a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and a pinch each of brown sugar, grated nutmeg, salt, pepper, and fresh thyme in a bowl. Cut one or more sweet potatoes into small wedges and coat each wedge in the mixture. Preheat your oven to 400°F and bake the sweet potatoes for 1 hour, turning them after 30 minutes. Round out the meal with a spinach salad with your choice of veggies and dressing. Assuming you eat about 4 ounces of sweet potato and 1 cup of spinach, this meal provides 58 g of carbs".</p>
