        <p>Good morning or good night depending where you are 😊 many people ask “how are you there in Singapore with all this Coronavirus situation?”. We are very good, just staying away from crowded places, making sure we are washing hands frequently and sanitise them each time we see a hand sanitiser 😄 (it’s almost impossible to buy one in any shop), and eating lots of vitamins C and A to boost our immune system 👊🏼 luckily Singapore didn’t run out of fruit stock 😃 we wishing everyone who has been affected by the virus, a speedy recovery and going back to normal life! 
Today for breakfast: homemade wholemeal toasted bread with mashed avocado and low fat cottage cheese, fruits 🍓🥭🥝 and coffee ☕️ __
