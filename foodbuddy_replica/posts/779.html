        <p>170 K is slightly more than Singapore island but its growing every day, so very soon RTI will really be 170 without any loops 🚴🏼 👍🏼! To all Russian Athletes - Happy Maslenitsa 😁✌🏼️(aka Crepe Week - Eastern Slavic religious and folk holiday celebrated during the last week before Great Lent)! On a side note, Singapore's landscape has one thing in common wit crepe - it's also very flat 😄</p>
