        <p>Throw back to Bali trip and Super delicious  fusion dal. Dal is an Indian soup made of lentils, peas, and beans. It is a good source of plant based protein, complex carbs (require longer digestion) and fiber (make you feel fuller). Legumes are good for athletes and generally for people who is trying to lose/control weight, because they are highly satiating food. This simply means that for the same amount of calories (compared to other less satiating food) you'll feel yourself fuller longer, hence will save yourself from snacking and extra weight.
