        <p>While we are baking awesome beef and potato pies let us share with you this absolutely delicious plant based plate from the day before 😉 
“Boring veggies” some of you may say. Well, it depends! If you, in addition to standard salt and pepper, add a dash of sesame oil to your lightly fried zucchini, a wonderful mix of low fat yoghurt, lemon juice and Tabasco sauce to your baked eggplants AND chaat masala powder you your baked potatoes - We are sure you’ll see your veggies from a more delicious perspective 😋 just try!
