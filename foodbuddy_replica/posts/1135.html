Self-made peanutbutter :)) The color doesn't look so delicious but it definitely is! :) Here's what you need:
- 230g peanuts (unsalted)
- 2 bananas
- 2tbsp oil (I took sunflower oil)
- 1tsp salt
- 1 drop of stevia liquid
-> roast the peanuts in the pan without oil and let them cool down a bit
-> mash the bananas and put all ingredients together in the mixer
-> mix it until it's as creamy as you like it
