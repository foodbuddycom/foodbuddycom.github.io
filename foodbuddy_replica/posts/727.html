        <p>Don't think I will ever stop enjoying this breakfast ☺️😋 Chia, flax, oats soaked in low fat yogurt and topped up with banana, blueberries, and raspberries 👍🏼 it's light yet nourishing, packed with so many micro nutrients and vitamins, it is a great source of energy! I love combination of fruits' sweetness and juiciness with quite boring 🙄(I think you will agree) taste of so powerful seeds and grains 😁
