This is a great healthy snack that will keep you full for a long time and don't be afraid to eat nuts.
Yes, they are calorie dense but nuts slow ⬇️ the rate at which you eat allowing time 🕝 for the satiety signals 💡to reach the brain telling it that you have had enough food😋👍🏼.
Pistachios, walnuts, almonds, macadamia nuts are the highest fiber nuts which also adds to the feeling of fullness and satiety which can keep you full longer than any cup cakes or fried noodle you thought you should have instead!</p>
