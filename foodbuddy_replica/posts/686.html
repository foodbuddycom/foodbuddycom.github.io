        <p>Looks light but it's quite filling 😉👍🏼 coconut meat is rich in fiber (1 cup contains 20% of daily norm) and fat... well, saturated fat ... but most of the fat in coconut is a medium chain fatty acid that are broken down much faster than long chain fatty acids, hence contributes less to cholesterol level. Moreover, coconut is rich in manganese (1 cup has 67% of daily norm) that helps metabolize both fat and protein; it is also rich in potassium (14% of daily norm) that supports fluid balance, muscle growth and heart function, and copper (39% of daily norm) important for the production of red blood cells ☝🏼 ------- #triathlon #ironmantri #healthyfood  #sportnutrition #running #swimbikerun #dietfood #cervelo #orbea #specializedbikes #giantbikes #canyonbikes #bmcbikes #boardmanbikes #ironmantraining #marathontraining #trailrunning #marathon #powersnack #powerbreakfast #coconut #fruits</p>
