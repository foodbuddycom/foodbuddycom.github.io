        <p>Recently we were asked about the benefits of quinoa and the first thought was “does this super food really need any introduction these days?” We love quinoa for its taste and fantastic nutrition profile. It has become pretty much a staple food in our house. For those who are not familiar with this Super Grain (technically it’s actually a seed, it’s just cooked like a grain) here’s what you need to know:
1️⃣ quinoa has twice as much fiber as any other grain and fiber is good for your digestion, gut health, appetite and weight control
2️⃣ it’s one of not so many plant based foods that contains sufficient amounts of all the essential amino acids, that makes it an excellent source of protein.
3️⃣ quinoa is rich in antioxidants that neutralize free radicals and are believed to help fight aging and many diseases.
4️⃣ it has low glycaemic index which is good for your blood sugar control 
5️⃣ quinoa is naturally gluten free!
6️⃣ it’s high in iron, zinc, potassium and magnesium 💪🏼 but its phytic acid can partly prevent them from being absorbed. It’s recommended to soak it before cooking to degrade most of the phytic acid.
7️⃣ Great for metabolic health. Using quinoa instead of typical gluten-free breads and pastas can significantly reduce blood sugar, insulin and triglyceride levels. 
8️⃣lastly, it’s really easy to incorporate it in your diet. Quinoa is very versatile, can be added to any meal: salads, side dishes, breakfast, soups you name it!
If you are not yet hooked on quinoa, you’d better do so if it’s easily available in your part of the world.
