Good Friday started with 94K ride around the city 🚴🏼‍♂️ and this awesome matcha oatmeal porridge with honey, seeds, nuts and berries 👌🏼😋 Here’s the recipe 📃 
INGREDIENTS: - 1 cup rolled oats (serving for 2)
- 2 tbsp of chia, flax, hemp seeds mix - almond milk 🥛 - 1 tbsp of matcha 🍵 powder - 1 tbsp of raw honey 🍯 - handful of mixed nuts of your choice 🥜
- fruits and berries of your choice 
METHOD: 
1️⃣ Mix rolled oats and seeds in a pot, add water and almond milk (proportion depends on your taste) 1 cm higher than oats and seeds 
2️⃣ Bring your porridge to boil and simmer on low fire. Add almond milk or water if it’s too dry and not yet cooked 
3️⃣ add matcha powder and honey to your porridge and mix well. 
4️⃣ once rolled oats are cooked, switch off fire. Pour your porridge to a bowl and top it up with nuts and fruits! 
ENJOY! It’s really a #powerbreakfast that will either help you replenish your glycogen storage after good training or will give you a great boost for a productive day 💪🏼 Stay strong and active everyone!
