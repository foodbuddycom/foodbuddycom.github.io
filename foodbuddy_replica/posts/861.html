        <p>Zucchini-bell pepper stew with chicken breast cubes and onion 😋👌🏼 healthy, juicy and delicious! Zucchini is very good if you want to control your weight and not compromise on nutrient value. They are low in calories and rich in fiber and water, hence you will feel satiety with less calories. Also zucchini contains significant quantities of potassium, folate, vitamins A, C, omega-3, carbs, and protein 👍🏼</p>
