        <p>After a long run it's worth to put your blender in action and made absolutely delicious lentil soup puree - definitely must try! 👍🏼 lentil is a complex carb, hence satiety comes faster and lasts longer 👌🏼 Make chicken breast broth, put aside. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a large sauce pan, add 1 garlic clove, 1/2 red onion, 1 fresh red chilli (thinly sliced), 1 sprig fresh rosemary, salt, stir for 2 min. Add 1 big potato, 200 g of red lentils, 400 g of can diced tomatoes, and chicken broth, bring to the boil. Cook until lentils are tender on reduced heat. Once cooked, add diced chicken breast, blend everything, TOP with  parsley or basil leaves 🍃🍲 #yumm 😋 wonderful mix of lean proteins and carbs!</p>
