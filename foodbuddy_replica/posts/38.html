        <p>How was your first week of 2021? We had LOTS of rain (it’s actually raining as I write this) lots of planning, early risings and new starts! New school start for elder one 📚 nursery for the first time for little one 🧸, Arseny has started swimming after very long break🏊🏼‍♂️, and I’ve doubled down on running🏃🏻‍♀️ 
Even more attention to nutrition and planning meals ahead 🗒 - this way we can make sure that there’s a yummy and instagramable 😂 breakfast ready at 5:30 am 😬 like this awesome homemade granola with low fat yogurt and fruits 👌🏼
