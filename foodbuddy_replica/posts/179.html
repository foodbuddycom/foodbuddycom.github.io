        <p>Well, well, well... new year celebration finished almost a week ago but I’m still getting over it 🤷🏼‍♂️. Our new year party was very happy 🍾😄🕺🏼💃🏻🍾 and silly 🤪 somewhere at 3 am, while waiting for a taxi, I saw a group with skateboards and immediately decided to master my kick flip 😎🤷🏼‍♂️😂 and for some reason I decided to do it barefoot (ah, don’t ask me why I don’t remember 🤔)... now I have 2 bleeding “souvenirs” on my left foot that remind me of new year celebration each time I run 🏃🏽(ouch, ouch, ouch). I didn’t make any resolutions for 2020 but one thing I know for sure I won’t do this year is a barefoot drunk kick flip 😄 
How was your new year celebration? Any happy moments or regrets? —
