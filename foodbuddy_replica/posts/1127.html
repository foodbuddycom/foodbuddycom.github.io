        <p>Happy Friday guys! Whenever you have a chance to scoot away to some tropical destination 🌴🌊🐬☀️ make sure you drink coconut water after your workouts 🏄🏽 as it has the same electrolyte balance found in isotonic drinks, proving useful for rehydration or after long periods of intensive exercise! 👍🏼 a lot of Athletes prefer coconut water to isotonic drinks, however, neither coconut water nor sports drinks contain enough sodium or carbs for the heavy perspirer. So complementing your post-workout drinks with a quick source of energy like a banana, raisins or handful of pretzels would work best of all to provide nutrients to replenish your stores. 😉</p>
