        <p>🥧MEAT PIE RECIPE 🥧 this is the taste of my childhood! In my culture we bake a lot! I probably won’t be able to beat my mom in baking skills as our lifestyle does not encourage lots of baking practices 😄 but who knows, a yummy pie can be a good motivation to train harder 😉 
Anyway, this pie (with a slight healthy modification) is not so sinful and just what you need for bonding time with family☺️

INGREDIENTS:
Dough
- 500 g bread flour 
- 200 g water 
- 6 tbsp sunflower oil
- 2 tsp salt 

Filling 
- 500 g minced beef 🥩 
- 500 g potato 🥔(sliced into small cubes, can leave skin on)
- 1 1/2 big yellow onion 🧅 cut onto
- salt and pepper to your taste 

COOKING METHOD: 
- Mix all dough ingredients and knead the dough (don’t overdo it, otherwise it will be hard to roll). 
- Set your dough aside, cover it with  a kitchen towel and let it rest.
- In the meanwhile, cut potatoes and onion, mix them with meat, add salt and pepper. 
- it is better to stew your filling until it’s semi-cooked. In fact, you can stew just potato and onion and later mix them with minced beef. This will help you bake the pie faster. If you put raw ingredients it will take forever to make your pie 🥱 
- roll 2 pie crusts and make one small ball from your dough. 1 of the crusts should be larger - you will use it for the bottom of the pie (it should cover the edges of your baking form). 
- apply sunflower oil or baking spray on bottom and walls of the baking form. Place the bottom crust, make sure that the edges of baking form are covered. 
- add semi-cooked filling and spread it evenly. 
- cover the filling with the second crust and pinch edges to form the pie. 
- make a hole in the middle of the pie and cover it with the dough ball that you made at the beginning. This is to control the filling inside your pie: you can add broth or water if it’s too dry; or you can open the hole if it’s too wet. 
- place your pie into preheated oven (200 C/392 F) and bake for 45-50 min. Check it occasionally. 
- Apply butter on the surface of your pie 10 min before it’s done. 
- Take the pie out once the filling is cooked. Set it aside and cover with towel. Let it rest and “breath”

Enjoy your pie! 🤗</p>
