        <p>This is a very delicious recipe of brown rice with shiitake mushroom üëçüèª definitely must try üòã I'm sure most of you know that brown rice is a very powerful grain but have you really looked into its nutrition profile? It is an excellent source of manganese, and a good source of fiber, selenium, magnesium, and niacin (vitamin B3).
Here's why you need them:
Manganese - Manganese helps produce energy from protein and carbohydrates, involved in the synthesis of fatty acids that support healthy nervous system, and in the production of cholesterol, which is used by the body to produce sex hormones. Manganese is also a critical component of a very important antioxidant enzyme called superoxide dismutase. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is found inside the body's mitochondria where it provides protection against damage from the free radicals produced during energy production.
Fiber & Selenium - great protection from colon cancer. Brown rice is a concentrated source of the fiber needed to minimize the amount of time cancer-causing substances spend in contact with colon cells, and being a good source of selenium that has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of colon cancer. Selenium is an essential component of several major metabolic pathways, including thyroid hormone metabolism, antioxidant defense systems, and immune function. In addition, selenium is incorporated at the active site of many proteins, including one of the body's most powerful antioxidant enzyme - glutathione peroxidase, which is particularly important for cancer protection. It is used in the liver to detoxify a wide range of potentially harmful molecules.
Finally, selenium also works with vitamin E in numerous other vital antioxidant systems throughout the body. These powerful antioxidant actions make selenium helpful in the prevention not only of cancer, but also of heart disease, and for decreasing the symptoms of asthma and the pain and inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis...</p>
