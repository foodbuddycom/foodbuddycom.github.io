        <p>Fruit plate for breakfast anyone? 😉🍌🍎🍊🍓 if you are not convinced yet, here are several reasons why eating fruits for breakfast is very beneficial to your health: 
Fruits will make you think clearer 🔆

Will help you lose weight and stimulate the digestive tract to energize the body 💪🏼 Great way to transition the body from a fasting state 🍽 to an eating state 🍲

Enhance detoxification phase 🌿☘ (Between 7 and 11am, the body is going through the heaviest phase of detoxification. Eating fruit will help contribute healing energy to this detoxification process, instead of hamper it by filling your body with anti-detox foods like fatty animal products that are hard to digest) 
Boost immune system with lots of vitamins and micro-elements 👊🏼 Drive out belly bloating with the help of fiber 😊

Good morning and happy Friday everyone! 😉☀️</p>
