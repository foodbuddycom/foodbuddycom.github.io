        <p>Can salad be a proper meal 🥗🤔 surely can if you won’t stop your creativity at 🍅 🥒 and 🍃 😄 this salad is super nourishing, delicious and packed with lots of valuable nutrients. We challenge you to guess what are these white noodles made of 😉 first one who will give the right answer will get a small present from us 😁 challenge stops at 9 am (Singapore time zone) on Saturday, Oct 27! Good luck 😉😘
Alright! Thanks for all your replies in direct messages. The right answer is - Shirataki or Konjac noodles and the winner is @weekendwarriortim 😊 10 SGD Starbucks voucher is waiting for you! If you guys haven’t tried Shirataki noodles you definitely should! They are also known as miracle noodles for their impressive health benefits. They're made from glucomannan, a type of fiber that comes from the root of the konjac plant. Glucomannan is a highly viscous fiber - a type of soluble fiber, and one of its main characteristics is the ability to absorb water and form a gel. These noodles move through the digestive system very slowly, which helps you feel full and delays nutrient absorption into the bloodstream - great food if you need to lose weight! Also, viscous fiber functions as a prebiotic. It nourishes the bacteria living in your colon, also known as the gut flora or microbiota ☝🏼
