        <p>A real athlete power smoothie:  blended Kiwis-raspberries-blueberries-strawberries 👍🏼 a great way to kick off the day. It's also a good snack before a light workout. Kiwi is extremely rich in vitamin C (more than orange) and potassium - an important electrolyte for a working endurance Athletes (regulates muscles and nerve activity). Blueberry is a powerful antioxidant because of its high concentrations of anthocyanin. It prevents our cells from mutation. Raspberry is also a powerful antioxidant rich in vitamin C and a range of phytonutrients that can help prevent free radicals from doing damage to your body. Intense training (🏃🏼 and 🏋🏼) can increase free radical production which slows down muscle repair. Also raspberry helps fight cardiovascular diseases❤️. And finally strawberry 🍓 -  is among TOP 3 fruits for Athletes. It is rich in vitamin C and, as Kiwi, helps your body fend off infections and produce collagen, which holds muscles and bones together. Vitamin C-rich foods also help prevent bruising, by enhancing iron and folate absorption. As fiber-rich foods, strawberries promote blood sugar control and lasting energy between meals. Have a great week ahead! 😉</p>
