        <p>Wonderful breakfast recipe from Matt Fitzgerald's The Endurance Diet book 👍🏼 - Custard oats with fruit and walnuts 🍌🌰(pecans are in the original recipe, but it is also good with walnuts) - in a saucepan mix 1/2 cup of water, 1/2 cup of almond milk (any fat level will work), pinch of salt, 2 tsp of brown sugar and 1/2 banana - bring to boil over medium heat. Add 1/2 cup of oatmeal, cook for 5 min stirring occasionally. Add egg whites and immediately start stirring for 1 min. Turn off heat, transfer to bowl, top with remaining banana slices, blueberries and nuts 😉
