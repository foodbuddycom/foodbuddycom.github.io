        <p>Sometimes even coffee can't save from Monday blues ☕️🤦‍♂️😄 on a serious note, in order to get better effect from you coffee during the race 🏁 don't forget to do a caffeine fasting before the race. Here's how Caffeine relates to triathlon, marathon and trailrunning. Caffeine is a vey close copy of adenosine which we produce naturally, especially at night. Many brain cells got adenosine receptors, they are like a bike deposit rail in T1 of ironmantri . Body doesn't produce adenosine => receptors empty => athlete feels wakeful and alert and performance of communication with  neural system (that manages muscles) is huge. When brain releases adenosine => athlete becomes sleepy => brain  slows down conmmunication with neural system => slower muscle response. LONG STORY SHORT: a shot of espresso or long black => caffeine links to adenosine receptors (replica!) => they can’t know it's not adenosine => adenosine receptors occupied => adenosine is prevented from completing its mission => no drowsiness and brain is fast. and feeling of alertness, mental acuity, energy. Drinking coffee every day (!!! even a cup or two a day!!!) makes brain "tweak" sensitivity of adenosine receptors => fewer adenosine volumes needed by receptors to cause sleepiness => caffeine reduces this #drug 's benefit of performance enhancement. SOOOO remove caffeine => huge exposure to adenosine via MUCH more sensitive receptors than usually => drowsiness, perceived fatigue, low morale, sad face like on the picture. BE AWARE - it takes ~10 days to re-set the balance. Only via #caffeine fasting nocaffeine . Especially before races (half-marathon and up) when there's no chance for coffee break. Give yourself an advantage by going off caffeine and then throw that extrashot 60 minutes before the race!When brain is not releasing adenosine, these receptors are empty => person feels wakeful and alert and signals between brain and neural system (that manages muscles) travel fast ☝🏼😉</p>
