        <p>Delicious and light chicken soup with shirataki noodles 👌🏼for those who don’t know: shirataki noodles are Japanese noodles made of konjac yam and they are very #yum 😋 they are mostly comprised of just water and a water-soluble fibre called glucomannan. Shirataki are the noodles to look for if you concern about your weight, they are extremely low in calories and carbs. Also they are gluten-free, vegan, paleo-friendly, and keto-friendly 😉👍🏼 Recipe: prepare chicken broth, add chopped potato, leek, enoki mushrooms, brown mushrooms (whatever mushrooms you have), lotus root, coon for 15 min, add shirataki noodles at the end and spices to your taste - enjoy!!! 😋
