        <p>Hi guys, I'm Barnabas Purbrook, from Nuun Sigma Sports London Race Team & this is #AthleteTakeover of @FoodBuddy account ðŸ˜Ž. Cycling is very important part of my life, and in this post I will share how I balance my trainings with full time job at an Asset Management company in London. Amateur cyclists with hectic working schedule - this post is specially for you ðŸ˜‰ 
I love racing. My favourite races are the National B road races, and I also enjoy racing in Belgium. My best results last year were winning the Simon Hook Memorial Road Race (a one day road race in east of England), winning 2 stages at the Giro Sardegna (and coming 3rd on GC), as well as few top 10s racing out in Belgium. The team race is a regular sight at top-tier races such as the Tour Series, Lincoln GP, National track meets + numerous National B and regional track races across the south of England.
I have to fit my training in and around my job which can be full on at times! I tend to train early in the morning, then after work if it's a double day & I do longer rides in at the weekend. Iâ€™m currently out in Singapore with work & really enjoying as the early morning sessions are definitely made easier in the warmth compared to winter training back in the UK! In SG, Iâ€™ve been training with the  @sgmavericks which has been great fun! 
So how do I train and fuel myself? During the week I have double training days Tues - Thur. 1st session is often an early morning one with the #Mavericks . I wake up at 4:20 am and I usually have my black coffee & a @nuunhydration tab. I also stick another Nuun tab in my bottle and take with me a bit of protein for after the ride! The rides are usually 1.5-2 hr. Once back its breakfast time, usually I grab some eggs, oats with a bit of fruit at 7:45 am. At 8:30 am I start my working day in the office. Lunch in Singapore is definitely varied (it's a famous food heaven), however I try to be consistent and stick to my favourite place at the moment - the @supersimple.sg. I usually grab a salad with chicken breast or tofu. If I have another tough session in the evening I add some whole grain carbs. Afternoon snack will be some fruit & handful of nuts.
