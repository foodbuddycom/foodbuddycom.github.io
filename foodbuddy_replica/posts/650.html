        <p>Made buckwheat pancakes for the first time - loved them a lot😋🥞! Enjoyed the taste more than the taste of pancakes made of white flour. Added a pinch of salt and just 0.5 tea spoon of fine brown sugar (you can easily skip it at all) Made berries compote (just boiled berries in their own juice a bit) that balanced pancakes taste with its amazing sweetness 👍🏼
