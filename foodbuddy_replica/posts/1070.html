        <p>Wine lovers, guess what?! Finally, scientists from the University of Alberta in Canada have found that health benefits in resveratrol, a compound found in red wine, are similar to those we get from exercise 😄💪🏼👍🏼🍷Resveratrol was seen to improve physical performance, heart function and muscle strength in the same way as they're improved after a gym session 🏋🏼 BUT, as you know, it's all about balance in this life ☝🏼️so only a moderate consumption of red wine can contribute to, and sometimes substitute, (if you can't exercise for some reason) a training session. Enjoy! 😜</p>
