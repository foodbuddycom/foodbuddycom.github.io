        <p>I'm still enjoying my winter holidays 😊 but even though it's -25 C outside ❄️☃❄️it feels like summer when I'm having dinner 🍲 🌞☘ A life hack to those who live in cold weather: deep freeze bell-peppers in the summer for your winter consumption☝🏼️. So you have more organic vegetables than those that you can buy in a grocery store in winter👌🏼. These stuffed peppers were extremely delicious!!!! Stuff your peppers with whatever you like - mincemeat with rice and onions can be an option👍🏼. Tip: use semi-cooked rice🍚, as meat, onion and peppers will be cooked much faster. Cook for about 30 min (depends on how you like your peppers and rice to be done - soft or crunchy) enjoy!</p>
