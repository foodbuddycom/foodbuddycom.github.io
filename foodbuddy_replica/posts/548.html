        <p>Power snack that you can easily make at home. I used: almonds 100g, dried apricots 160g, prunes 150g, raisins 28g, honey 1 tbsp, chia seeds 4 tbsp, flax seeds 4 tbsp, 1 lemon with zest, grated coconut. Blend almonds, dried apricots, prunes, and raisins until they can be formed into snack balls. Separately blend lemon and add it to dry (and sticky😁) blend together with chia, flax, and honey. Form snack balls, cover each with grated coconut and store in the fridge 👍 With proportions mentioned above I made 17 balls. So each snack ball is only about 120 Cal, 17g carbs and 10g sugar, however, such snack will keep you going for much longer period of time than any junk food, delicious cookie or candy. Make smart choices 😜
