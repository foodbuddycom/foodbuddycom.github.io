        <p>Have you ever seen tandyr/tandoor right in a supermarket? 😃 I haven’t 🤷🏻‍♀️ it’s so cool to buy hot and fresh tandoor nan (tandoor bread) - temptation to eat this bread right at the spot is so high 🤤 “Tandyr is a an oven on ground or dug into ground, usually built of clay. In different countries it is called – tundur, tunur, tanur, turn, Tandr, tendir, tandoori, tandyr, etc. This type of ovens is widespread in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, India, Iran, and China.”
“Mostly it is used for baking bread and cooking meat, but generally any type of food can be cooked in tandyr ovens. The secret of tandyr oven is process of heating up the oven. Wood is put on the ground and ignited. It is necessary to wait till it becomes glowing charcoal. By this moment the oven will reach temperatures of around 400*C. The food is basically cooked from the heat of the walls. High temperature ensures very fast cooking.”
