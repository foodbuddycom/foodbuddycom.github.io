        <p>Dips and avocado ðŸ¥‘ rolls at sunset. Interesting serving: the same tin boxes for hummus, baba ghanoush and yoghurts are used in rooms for welcome candy and cookie sets, in bar for snacks, and at breakfast for hard boiled eggs (filled with some grains, egg is plugged in to the tin, looks great). When these tin boxes are in a yet larger fold they, as you see, created a spectacular plate. Wooden spoons  were more like spatulas for the spread. And yep, everything was delicious.
