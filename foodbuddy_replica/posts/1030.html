        <p>Woke up in the morning ready for a long (30 km @ 5.00/km) run and great craving for chia breakfast! 🏃🏼💪🏼 If you, like me, haven't plan your chia breakfast just soak the seeds in warm milk for 7-10 min 😉 no need to keep them in the fridge overnight! 🕐 look how much you can get out of 2.5 tbsp of chia seeds😋 what's more important this portion will source about 14 g of fiber, 5 g of protein, 6 g of Omega-3 fats, 20% of calcium, 35% of magnesium, manganese, and phosphorus ☝🏼️ Chia seeds also contain a decent amount of Zinc, Vitamin B3 (Niacin), Potassium, Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) and Vitamin B2 AND ONLY 140 CALORIES AND 1 G OF DIGESTIBLE CARBS! 👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼 no wonder chia is considered as one of the healthiest foods on our planet and so expensive 💸💸💸</p>
