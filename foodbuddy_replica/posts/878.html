        <p>Still eating calamari/squid rings fried? How about trying to bake them? Breaded baked calamari is as delicious as fried one, if not better 👌🏼😋 and definitely healthier 💪🏼! Baked calamari is low in calories and rich in protein (an ounce of plain calamari offers 4.4 grams of protein - 9% of daily value) - will help you build healthy muscles and keep you appetite under control (body processes protein slowly, helping you stay full longer) calamari is also rich in calcium, vitamin B12, phosphorus, vitamin C 👍🏼</p>
