        <p>How are you dealing with stress these days? 
At times, the level of our frustration is so high (full time jobs from home with 2 kids is not a joke at all) that our @garmin watches send us a Stress Alert and suggest to come down ðŸ˜¬ Thanks Garmin! 
We still can run and cycle and we count our blessings, living day by day - all these really help to deal with stress. But we also remember how tricky anxiety & stress. What they do to our body and brain is draining essential vitamins and minerals, when we need them the most. To prevent this, we keep our nutrition healthy as it helps to deal with stress. Let's talk about this.

Certain foods, due to vitamins and minerals that they contain, can protect you from harmful impact of stress, calm your nervous system, suppress inflammation of your body and brain, reduce depression symptoms, stimulate production of feel-good neurotransmitters GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid - the brain chemical of relaxation), serotonin, and dopamine. 
Add to your nutrition food reach in B-complex vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and zinc. 
B-complex vitamins are especially good at dealing with work-related stress, anxiety and personal strain. It will give you more energy, keep you in a good mood and make you more stress resistant. 
Vitamin C reduces inflammation in your body, which directly impacts your stress level, and bolsters your immune system.

Magnesium restricts the release of stress hormones and acts as a filter to prevent them from entering the brain. It also alleviates anxiety by reducing chronic brain inflammation, removing heavy metals from the brain, and stabilising blood sugar levels.

Zinc plays an important role in modulating your response to stress. It is needed to synthesize GABA and balance its activity.

So here's the list of what you should include into your nutrition to support your nervous system and body: whole grains, legumes, nuts & seeds, spinach and other green leafy veggies, regular & sweet potato, tomatoes, okra, bell peppers, asparagus, mushrooms, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, lean meat, poultry & fish, milk, all citrus fruits, bananas, berries, avocado, herbal & green teas.
