        <p>This is not another food picture but a post inspired by one of the biggest confusions that we observe among regular guys (not triathletes) with higher BFI/BMI, especially in Singapore. 
Here's the summary of their mistakes:
MISTAKE #1: cut down carbohydrates, i.e. eat less grains like brown rice, wheat, rye, oats, or avoid legumes like beans, peas, lentils, potatos, or even fruits and vegetables.
When one cuts down carbs, "As They Say", they deprive themseves from THE MOST important energy-yielding macronutritient, which is important in our diet, as well as from fiber, that is important bulking agent that delays gastric emptying.
MISTAKE #2: carry on eating visible fats like butter on bread, mayonnaise and sour cream, thick salad dressings, fatty animal meat, and consume hidden fats from full-fat dairy, pastries and cakes, french fries or curry gravies.
Lipids, aka Fats & Oils, have many important roles, but among them they are the densest energy reserves (9 kcal/g) in our body. This is where extra unused calories from carbs, alcohol (and even protein) go, We need to "activate" these fat reserves, INSTEAD of continuously topping them up!
But, we can't completely turn away from fats & oils, as we need Essential Fatty Acids (EFA-s), that are not produced by our bodies, especially Omega-3 and Omega-6. We need them for more than 100 different actions, like regulating blood presure or controlling bood clotting. Dietary fats from our food are needed to transport and absorb vitamins.  Everything should be in moderation.
Just watch out for Saturated fats and Transfats. Transfat even gets in to nerve cell membranes and negatively impacts them. Watch out for those biscuits from palm oil! Avoid deep-frying food, as frying will converts even healthier oils to Saturated fats. Watch out for hidden fats in dairy. And, if you're able to, cut down fatty animal meat as much as you can, at least to reduce weight. Not only it's saturated fat, but it's the external source of non-essential cholesterol (we can produce it ourselves even without meat, i.e. for bile, some steroid hormones and vitamin D), and thus a thread of atherosclerosis.
