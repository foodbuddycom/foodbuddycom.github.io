        <p>Literally loud and clear 😁 - a handful of sunflower seeds will make your salad not only tasty but will also add good amount of vitamin E - important antioxidant, magnesium - good for your nerves, muscles and blood vessels, selenium - important trace mineral that helps fight cancer. "Selenium is incorporated at the active site of many proteins, including glutathione peroxidase, which is particularly important for cancer protection. One of the body's most powerful antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase is used in the liver to detoxify a wide range of potentially harmful molecule" ☝🏼 -----
