        <p>Absolutely delicious recipe of Moroccan Stew from Matt Fitzgerald's new book - The Endurance Diet 🤤 👌🏼1 can of diced tomatoes 🍅 , 4-5 large carrots 🥕, 1 green bell pepper, 2 ribs of celery, 1 chopped onion, 2 garlic cloves, 1 potato (original recipe suggests sweet potato🍠 but I used normal potato because don't really like sweet food), 1 inch of ginger root, 3 cups of chicken or vegetable broth, 2 tsp each ground cumin, curry powder, ground coriander, 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper (add more if you like it hot 🌶) 1 can of chickpeas (1 used ~ 250 g of dried chickpeas), 4 cups of kale - chop all ingredients and add to large pot (everything ex. kale), bring to boil and simmer over small heat until chickpeas and potato. You can also add raisins and peanut butter (original recipe) if you like it sweet 😉 🍲enjoy!</p>
