        <p>Tried for the first time and fell in love with this vegetarian poke bowl 🤤 from @apoketheory 
Quinoa base with 🥑, 🥒, 🍅, 🍍, 🥕, edamame and wakame seaweed toppings! That was a very fiber reach lunch, which I couldn’t finish in one go, with the mix of so many different flavors: sweet and sour and spicy and juicy and crunchy and creamy 😋 worth trying to replicate it at home 👍🏼
