        <p>Fat-loading breakfast 👊🏼 for those who are getting ready for a race 🏁 🏃🏻during next 2 weeks. Fat loading is an optional phase of the taper diet. A brief (5 days) fat-loading phase allows you to increase your fat-burning capacity for a race without compromising your training. During fat-loading phase 60-65% of your daily calories must come from fat. Remember that there're not so many high-quality foods that get more 60% of their calories from fat. Eat avocado, cheese, nuts, Greek yogurt, olives, salmon, whole milk, sardines during fat-loading phase 👍🏼</p>
