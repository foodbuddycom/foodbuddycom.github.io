        <p>Have you ever eaten lotus root? If not you should try to add it to your stews and soups. It has neural taste and looks pretty 😄, but most importantly it is loaded with nutrients! It’s not calorie rich, 100 g of root contains only 74 calories, however it contains 13% of daily norm of dietary fiber, good amount of vitamin C (better eat it fresh to get the best of vitamin C), moderate level of valuable B-complex group, also copper, iron, zinc, magnesium, and manganese! This crunchy root vegetable has optimum electrolyte balance. It composes agreeable ratio of sodium to potassium at the value 1:4 👍🏼 That was a very yummy beef and veggies stew 👌🏼 mixed beef slices with carrot 🥕bell-pepper, broccoli 🥦 cauliflower, onion, potato 🥔 eggplant 🍆 lady fingers/okra, and lotus root.
