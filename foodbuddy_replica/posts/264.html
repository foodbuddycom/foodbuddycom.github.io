        <p>We love Chinese New Year 🧧 🎉🐉 🦁 - it is a very colourful celebration, there’s a lot of symbolism and so much fun like for example prosperity toss of the salad 🥢🥗 - Lo Hei Yusheng (swipe left to see how it is done). Lo Hei is not a common tradition in China, and it is believed that prosperity tossing was created in Singapore 🇸🇬 (however our Malaysian friends claim that it was created there 🇲🇾😄) Every ingredient in the salad has a meaning: 🍣 The fish is for abundance through the year
🍋 Pomelo or lime is added to the fish - good luck and auspicious value - smooth sailing 🧂Pepper is then dashed over in the hope of attracting more money and valuables.
🥕Carrots are added indicating blessings of good luck
🥬 Shredded green radish is later added symbolising eternal youth
⚪️ After which the shredded white radish is added - prosperity in business and promotion at work 
The condiments are finally added. 🥜 First, peanut crumbs are dusted on the dish, symbolising a household filled with gold and silver
🥣 Yu Sheng sauce, usually made from plum sauce, is generously drizzled over everything as a symbol of sweet life
🥠 Deep-fried flour crisps in the shape of golden pillows is then added with wishes that literally the whole floor would be filled with gold! 🤗 
Some people toss the salad so high that it sticks on the ceiling 😂 good reminder about prosperity for the whole year I guess 😬
