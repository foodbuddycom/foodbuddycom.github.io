        <p>This is a very juicy and joyful salad 🥗😋🙃 delicious combination of bitter lemons, fresh mint, kale, and cilantro leaves, juicy cherry tomatoes and bell peppers seasoned with olive oil, molasses, a bit of glaze with balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper - will make you smile 😊 this salad will satisfy your sweet tooth cravings and still provide you with all necessary micro-elements, fiber, and carbs 👍🏼 TIP: blanch slices of 2 lemons in boiling water for 2 min, then drain and mix them with olive oil and 1 tsp of super fine sugar and bake in the oven for 15 min until they are caramelized 👌🏼 --------
