        <p>Multi-purpose power bowl 🍲 - oatmeal porridge with banana, blueberries and walnuts😄 works perfectly well to boost energy for a long endurance training / working day (especially after sleepless night 😬), or to recover after workout / race. 🌾 Oats have very balanced nutritional composition, they are a great source of carbs, fiber and contain more protein & fat than most grains. 🍌 Bananas are famous for their content of  potassium (however, there are fruits with higher potassium content, avocado 🥑 for example), which is one of the most important minerals in the body. It helps regulate fluid balance, muscle contractions and nerve signals. 💙 Blueberries and walnuts are great source of antioxidants, which we need to fight the damage made to our muscles by free radicals. Walnuts are also very rich in omega-3 fatty acids - very important fat for our heart health❣ make wise food choices and stay healthy 😉
