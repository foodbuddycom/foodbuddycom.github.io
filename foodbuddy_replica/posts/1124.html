        <p>Do you guys practice a week of caffeine fasting before your race? If not, give a try but test it before important races with a long workout or a simulator, as it might not work well for everybody. Caffeine has direct impact on the level of adenosine - a chemical that transmits signals that induce drowsiness and slow down the brain. When you drink coffee/energy drinks daily you might not feel the effect of caffeine on your sport performance as the brain "upregulates"  its adenosine receptors BUT a week of caffeine fasting brings the level of adenosine back to normal and a cup of strong coffee right before the race should give you a maximum possible benefit of caffeine intake ☕️🏊🏼🚴🏼🏃🏼💨 and NO sugar! ☝🏼️😉</p>
