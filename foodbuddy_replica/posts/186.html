        <p>Good morning friends! It’s officially a rainy season in Singapore 🌧🌧🌧 it has been pouring nonstop for past few days and the only sun we see is on our plate ☀️ it’s actually a great relief after many months of hot weather but it unfortunately affects cycling training 🚴🏼‍♂️ and everyone fall sick 🤧 offices in Singapore become extremely cold 🥶 during rainy season - no joke! No one bothers to adjust air conditioning in business centres. 
Kicking of the day with power breakfast: low-fat yogurt with oats, chia and flax seeds, guava, mango 🥭 passion fruit, pear, Kiwi 🥝 and mixed nuts! 💪🏼
