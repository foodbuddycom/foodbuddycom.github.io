        <p>If anyone asks us what’s the best vegetable in the world, I think we’ll answer EGGPLANT 🍆  how about you? 
Here’s why we like eggplant:
1️⃣ It tastes really nice and in fact, it can change its taste a bit, depending  on how you cook it. It matches perfectly with pretty much any sauce 🤤 (the one on picture is low fat yogurt with herbs and Chilli powder)
2️⃣ It’s rich in carbs and low in calories - great food for weight loss and control 👍🏼
3️⃣ it’s rich in other micro-nutrients and antioxidants that can protect us from different chronic diseases and cellular damage.
4️⃣ it’s easy to cook! Well, you always can do a very complicated dish with eggplants but a simple roast with a dash of olive oil salt and pepper is absolutely yummy too.
