        <p>Double tap and click on “save” button if you are looking for something refreshing and energising this hot summer day ☀️ - this smoothie bowl made of matcha 🍵 , banana 🍌 kiwi 🥝 and low fat yogurt is all you need 👌🏼 It’s so so so hot in Singapore these days 🥵 and we were craving for a smoothie that is fresh, not too sweet and can energise as good as cup of coffee 😄 matcha - kiwi-banana mix of tastes went really well and met all our expectations. Matcha tea has good caffeine content, equal to a cup of brewed coffee or 1/2 cup of espresso. However caffeine buzz in match is more energising and long-lasting thanks to the amino acid L-Theanine, which slows the release of caffeine and has a calming, relaxing effect 👍🏼 __
