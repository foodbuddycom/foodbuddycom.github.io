        <p>While most of us were going crazy and hoarding rice, noodles and buckwheat, getting ready to protect ourselves from #coronavirus, poor cabbage was overlooked and remained untouched on the shelves in grocery stores üòÑ if only she could tell us how good she is for our health and immune system üí™üèº It has impressive nutrient content:
1Ô∏è‚É£ high in Vitamin C (especially red cabbage) and other powerful antioxidants, such as polyphenols and sulfur compounds - protect body from damage caused by free radicals, prevent inflammation
2Ô∏è‚É£ rich in vitamin B6 and Folate - essential for energy metabolism and normal function of our nervous system
