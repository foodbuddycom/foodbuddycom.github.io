        <p>From all my posts you might've guessed that I normally don't eat rice 🍚 ❌ but today's amazing lunch - brown rice with chicken breast and veggies 👌🏼 made me think about including it into my diet for pre and post training meal 🤔🍛🏊🏼🏄🏽🏃🏼🍚
Seriously, brown rice is a virtually fat-free rich source of complex carbs (makes your energy last longer) accompanied with high fiber (helps you digest better), protein (rebuilds your muscles) and magnesium (which in combination with calcium builds bones and teeth, and helps muscles contract). I love this whole grain 👍🏼 what do you think, guys? 🤔</p>
