        <p>Have you already planned your Friday dinner? Hereâ€™s an easy and delicious, rich in fiber, carbs, vitamins and minerals dinner: - mix of brown and red rice - blanched broccoli ðŸ¥¦ - Ottolenghi's Braised Fennel with Capers and Olives ðŸ¤¤
Iâ€™m sure you know how to cook rice and blanch broccoli in boiling water for few min, as well as roast tomatoes on the pan ðŸ˜‰ but let me share braised fennel recipe from genius Chef @ottolenghi: 
Ingredients: 
2 fennel bulbs, trimmed
1 Tbsp olive oil
15 cloves garlic, skin on
1/4 cup verjus, or a mixture 1/4 cup lemon juice and 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar
1 large tomato, cut into a dice
1 cup vegetable stock
2 1/2 Tbsp capers
3 1/2 Tbsp black olives, pitted and cut into quarters
1 Tbsp chopped thyme leaves
2 1/2 tsp sugar
ricotta (optional)
1 tsp grated lemon zest
salt and black pepper

Instructions:
1. Trim the tops off the fennel and cut each bulb into thick slices.
2.  In a large frying pan heat 1 tablespoon of oil on a medium to high heat. Add half the fennel with some salt and some black pepper. Cook for five or six minutes, turning once, so the fennel is nicely browned on both sides; remove from the pan and repeat with the remaining fennel.
3.  Keep the empty pan on the heat, add the garlic and fry for three minutes, tossing occasionally, so the skin is scorched all over. Lower the heat to medium, carefully add the verjus (or lemon and vinegar) and reduce for a couple of min until there are about two tablespoons of liquid left in the pan. Add the tomato, 1/4 cup of the stock, the capers, olives, thyme, sugar, some salt and black pepper. Bring to a simmer, cook for 2 minutes, then return the fennel to the pan. Add the remaining stock, put on the lid and leave to simmer for ~12 minutes, turning once during the cooking, until the fennel is soft and the sauce has thickened. (remove the lid and increase the heat for the last 2-3 minutes.) 4. Place slices of fennel on each plate, spoon over the sauce and serve with a spoonful of ricotta (if using) and some freshly grated lemon zest. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil & serve.
