        <p>Most likely now you have time to finally cook all sorts of complicated fancy dishes 👩🏻‍🍳🧑🏼‍🍳 while waiting at home till this madness is over 🙈 but for those who still don’t have time for cooking (or hate to spend too much time at the kitchen) here’s a simple idea of healthy lunch / dinner! 😉
Baked zucchini and butternut squash, brown rice, chicken breast and kale leaves! All can be cooked in parallel and will take not more than 30 min. 🥒🔪 Just cut veggies, season and bake them in oven at 200C/ 350F for ~30 min (less time required for zucchini); 💦 rinse rice, put it in a pot, add water, bring to boil, add salt and simmer till it’s cooked; 🍗 cut chicken breast, season it with salt, pepper and favourite spices, fry on pan (do t add oil, if you want it juicy, cover it with a lid and don’t cook on high heat. 🍲This power bowl is a good source of lean proteins and carbs (healthy ones ☝🏼). It was our recovery meal after run today 🏃🏽‍♀️🏃🏽‍♂️... how do you guys keep up with your trainings at home these days? We still can go out for exercises in Singapore thankfully, but ready for anything... __
