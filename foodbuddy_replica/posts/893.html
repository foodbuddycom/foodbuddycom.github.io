        <p>This ricotta-chicken salad with beans is a great pre-training meal 🍲🏊🏽🚴🏼🏃🏾👍🏼 carbs, protein, fats are well balanced plus beans: kidney beans, chickpeas, corn, peas - natural protein - carbohydrate combination and a great source of energy 💪🏼. Beans have low GI, hence provide slow burning complex carbohydrates. Kidney beans are rich in iron and can increase your energy by helping to replenish your iron stores. Beans are also very rich in soluble fiber - help protect against heart disease by lowering the cholesterol in your blood. Also, beans are naturally low in fat and dietary cholesterol, so replacing meats with beans is a heart-healthy swap. Beans are good sources of fuel for the health-promoting bacteria that live in your gut and support immune system 💪🏼 👊🏼</p>
