        <p>Adding grapes 🍇 to your salad - a very good idea 👍🏼 especially after the training. Grapes provide a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory support which is very much needed after workouts. Grapes are also rich in vitamin K that is absolutely essential for strong bones, and copper - important trace mineral that plays a role in energy production 💪🏼 grapes also have low GI</p>
