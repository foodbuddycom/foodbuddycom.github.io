        <p>Celebration of Chinese New Year is all over China and South East Asia since Feb 16th. This is a traditional Chinese New Year salad in Southeast Asia. The name of this dish is Yusheng. “Yusheng, yee sang or yuu sahng or Prosperity Toss, also known as lo hei is a Cantonese-style raw fish salad. It usually consists of strips of raw fish (sometimes salmon), mixed with shredded vegetables and a variety of sauces and condiments, among other ingredients. Yusheng literally means "raw fish" but since "fish (魚)" is commonly conflated with its homophone "abundance (余)", Yúshēng (魚生) is interpreted as a homophone for Yúshēng (余升) meaning an increase in abundance. Therefore, yusheng is considered a symbol of abundance, prosperity and vigor.
The current version of this dish was popularized by ethnic Chinese in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, and associated with Chinese New Year celebration.
“The recipe included ingredients such as shredded white and green radish and carrots, ginger slices, onion slices, crushed peanuts, pomelo, pepper, essence of chicken, oil, salt, vinegar, sugar and more”. Traditionally, guests have to toss all ingredients by raising them into the air as high as possible with very long chop sticks and toast to prosperity, good health, luck and whatever they want in new year 😊 - nice tradition and sweet and sour salad.
