        <p>Plant based food is in the center of our nutrition, however, few times a week we do eat lean meat. Chicken breast is the most common choice of lean meat and, tbh, it can be pretty boring, I think many of you will agree. 
Iâ€™m on a constant search for some easy yet delicious recipes that can make our nutrition routine brighter, which is needed like never before during this COVID year. 
Yesterday we cooked a braised chicken breast with shiitake mushrooms from @omnivorescookbook, which we had to modify a bit since we were short of 2 ingredients (spring onion and dry shiitake mushrooms). It turned out to be very scrumptious so, no regrets for missing ingredients. 

INGREDIENTS THAT WE USED: 
* 250 g fresh shiitake mushrooms, halved 
* 1 kg chicken breast, chopped into 3 cm / ~1.5 in cubes
* 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine 
* 1 thumb-size (20 grams / 0.7 ounces) ginger, finely chopped 
* 1 whole star anise
* 200 grams enoki mushrooms (or any mushrooms you have)
* 1 stem leek, thinly sliced 
* 2 tbsp light soy sauce
* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
* 1 tsp sugar
* 3/4 teaspoon salt

COOKING METHOD:
1. Put chicken breast cubes into a large pot filled with water, cover pot and bring to boil. Remove the lid and cook for 10 min on a medium heat. Remove the foam from the surface with big ladle
2. Transfer the chicken to a wok (or dutch oven). Pour in chicken broth until it almost completely covers the chicken. Add Shaoxing wine, ginger, and star anise. After bringing to a boil, simmer covered over low heat for 20 minutes.
3. Add leek (our substitute for green onion), light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and 1/2 tsp salt into the wok. Mix all ingredients. Add shiitake and enoki mushrooms on top. Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Turn back to low heat and simmer covered until chicken turns soft, 20 to 30 minutes. Check the chicken occasionally to avoid burning. Check the salt and add a bit if needed.
4. Turn to high heat and boil uncovered. Use a spatula to scoop the chicken from the bottom constantly, until the sauce is thick enough to coat the chicken, 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Transfer chicken to a plate and serve with quinoa! 
This is a great recovery meal rich in protein & minerals!</p>
