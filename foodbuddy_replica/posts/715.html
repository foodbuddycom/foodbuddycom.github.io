        <p>Zeaty green smoothie - recipe is from The Endurance Diet by Matt Fitzgerald: 1 celery stick, 1 banana, 1/4 avocado, 1 kiwi, 1 scoop of protein powder (I didn't add), 1 handful of leafy greens, 1 cup of chilled green tea. I used spinach and didn't like how it tasted, will try kale next time, also added chia - not bad. Good smoothie but you really need to love celery to enjoy it 100% ðŸ˜¬ what's your favorite green smoothie?
