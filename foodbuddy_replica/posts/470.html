        <p>It’s been a while since our last post - we’ve been traveling to Russia and Kazakhstan and were in food coma 😂sharing with you our experience of cooking Manti - dumplings popular in most Turkic cuisines, as well as in the Caucasian, Central Asian, Chinese Islamic, and Hejazi cuisines where it was brought by Central Asian settlers. Manti resemble the Chinese jiaozi, Korean mandu, Mongolian buuz, and the Tibetan momo, and the dish's name is cognate with the Korean mandu, Chinese mantou, and Japanese manjū. 
Eat with sour-cream and soya sauce - it’s EXTREMELY DELICIOUS! Make sure your manti are not torn - the juice inside them is the most delicious part of eating experience 👌🏼
