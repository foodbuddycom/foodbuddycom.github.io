        <p>Have a fruitful week ahead guys! 😉 Kicked off Monday in a very juicy and and vitamins rich way: fruit plate, chia-flax-low fat yogurt mix and coffee! 
Such fruit plate is a great source of vitamin C - our immune booster 💪🏼It’s hard to believe but it’s winter in Singapore 😬 no, we don’t have snow and low temperature but it’s very rainy, windy and almost no sunshine. We say in Singapore that it is hot outside and cold inside everywhere you go because of air conditioning. Just a few degrees change outside makes a lot of difference in offices - becomes freezing cold and people easily get sick 🤒 how are you protecting yourself this winter?
