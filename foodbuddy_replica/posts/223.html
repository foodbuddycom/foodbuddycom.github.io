        <p>This is yummy traditional Russian cheesecakes - Syrniki that we’ve been craving in Singapore for so long (here we don’t have a big variety of cottage cheese like in Russia) until our friend shared a lifehack that paneer cheese is a perfect substitute 😃👌🏼 so guys, save this recipe: 500 g of paneer cheese, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup of flour, 1 tea spoon of vanilla extract, 1 tea spoon of baking powder and sugar to your taste (1 tbsp was enough for us), bake or fry lightly from both sides and  enjoy this awesome dessert 😉
