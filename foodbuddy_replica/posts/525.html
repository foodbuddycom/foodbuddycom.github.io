Tomorrow morning I’ll be racing #IMKona for my 6th time. I’ll be wearing bib #17. For the first time it will be broadcasted live on NBC & NBCSN. It will also be broadcasted on @Ironmantri live. Feeling grateful to have my wife, 3.5 month old son and father with me here. Thankful and blessed as each day really is a gift from God. Thank you all for the support!</p>
