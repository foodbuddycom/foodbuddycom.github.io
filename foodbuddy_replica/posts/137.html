        <p>🥭Mango lassi is our favourite type of smoothie 🤤 it’s super delicious and so easy to make, especially now, when it’s a mango season in Thailand (Thai mango are yellow, have long shape and they are very sweet), so they are everywhere on markets of Southeast Asia. 
Anyway, what’s lassi? Lassi is a popular, traditional, yogurt-based drink that originated in India. Indian Lassi is a blend of yogurt, water, spices and sometimes fruit. 
As you can imagine, there are tons of variations of Lassi, but the Indian Mango Lassi is one of the most popular variants.

Recipe is simple: 
1️⃣ 2 ripe mango 🥭 
2️⃣ 1 cup of natural low fat yogurt or kefir 
3️⃣ 1/2 cup of milk (we didn’t add milk to our lassi but I think it really depends on thickness and taste of your yogurt)
4️⃣ sugar/honey and spices (pinch of cardamom or cinnamon) optional and to your taste.
Our mangos were so sweet that we didn’t need to add sugar or honey. 
5️⃣ blend everything well and leave in a freezer for 10 min. You can also keep your mango cubes in a freezer over night before you cook, in this case your lassi will be ready for consumption immediately 👌🏼
