        <p>If you travel to Thailand for the first time, most likely you will wonder what is Morning Glory in menus of all Thai cafes & restaurants 🤔? It is same as Kangkong (name used in other Southeast Asian countries) 😉 OR simply Water Spinach 😄! This is a dish you should definitely order because it’s delicious (usually it’s stir fried with oyster and soya sauces, garlic, rice wine, soya bean paste, chilli) 👌🏼🤤 but MOST IMPORTANTLY it is one of the world’s HEALTHIEST foods that is PACKED with valuable NUTRIENTS! Vitamin A - 136%, Vitamin C - 154%, Calcium - 11%, Iron - 14%, Potassium - 468% RDV! Water spinach is a great source of fiber and perfect food for those who is trying to lose some weight, manage cholesterol level in the most natural way, address indigestion and constipation. Regular consumption of water spinach helps in developing resistance against diabetes induced oxidative stress. Morning Glory is loaded with 13 different types of antioxidant compounds, which makes it a perfect diet for prevention of cancer. High content of vitamin A, C and beta-carotene (antioxidants) prevents cholesterol from becoming oxidized (sticks to the walls of blood vessels), hence prevent blockage of arteries, heart attacks and strokes. It boosts immunity (especially in combination with chilli 🌶👍🏼) and it is a food you should add to you diet if you have problems with skin (acne, eczema and psoriasis etc) —-
