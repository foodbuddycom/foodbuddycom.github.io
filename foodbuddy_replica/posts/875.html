        <p>Berries are very important in endurance athletes' diet as they are the most nutritionally dense fruits and loaded with antioxidants 👊🏼this makes berries a powerful tool that athletes can use to reduce delayed onset muscle soreness (pain after workouts caused by multiple micro-tears in muscles). Frequent consumption of berries reduces oxidative stress and inflammation 👍🏼 try blueberry-strawberry-grapes🍓🍇 (or whatever seasonal berries you have) smoothie with chia , flax and mint🍃 - super delicious and healthy 👌🏼😋</p>
