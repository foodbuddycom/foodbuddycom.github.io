        <p>Worth to be saved Chicken Soup recipe 📝🍲👌🏼 1/2 chicken - make a chicken broth. Once chicken is cooked - take it out, cool it down and cut into cubes. 
In parallel sauté vegetables:
2 big carrots cut into thin 5 cm stripes 🥕 
3 medium potatoes cut into cubes 🥔 
1 large leek chopped 
2 garlic cloves crushed 
2 fresh thyme sprigs
1 fresh rosemary sprig 
Don’t add oil when cooking veggies, use chicken broth instead. 
Once veggies are semi-cooked, add them to chicken broth together with chicken cubes. 
Add soba noodles at the end as they will cook very fast. 
Add salt and pepper to your taste. Enjoy! 😉
