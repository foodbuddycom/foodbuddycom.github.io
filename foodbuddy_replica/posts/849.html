        <p>This is probably the coolest moment in eating poached eggs 😋 poaching is one of the healthiest ways to prepare eggs as the valuable nutrients are preserved and inflammatory-causing compounds are not produced (which is the case when you fry eggs). Poached eggs are rich in protein (you strong muscles), calcium (your healthy bones), iron (your red blood cells formation), lutein & zeaxanthin (antioxidants that support your muscles from degeneration), choline (your healthy liver, brain and muscles) 👍🏼</p>
