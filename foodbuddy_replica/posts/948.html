        <p>You can't be wrong going🌿 green 🍃. Making this salad I mixed pretty much everything I had in my fridge and it was amazing 😄! Try it too: mixed green salad, pea sprouts, cilantro, mint, green peas, cucumber, just a little bit of raisins, olives and corn. Add salt, pepper and olive oil to your taste👌🏼 enjoy 😉</p>
