        <p>Inspired by Uzbek Plov (rice pilaf) or when you donâ€™t have time to cook proper plov (I promise Iâ€™ll do it one day and share the recipe with you) and donâ€™t have space for more delicious calorie from plov ðŸ˜„ 
HERE YOU GO:
âž–cooked brown rice (being to boil and simmer until soft but not loosing its form)
CHICKEN RECIPE:
âž– we used half of chicken, skinned and cut into cubes
âž– 1 big onion, thinly sliced in half moons 
âž–1 big carrot, cut into thin strips 
âž–1 tbsp dried barberry 
âž–1 tsp ground turmeric 
âž–1 good pinch of saffron 
âž–1/2 tbsp of salt 
âž– freshly grounded black pepper and cayenne pepper (or ground chilli )
âž–2 tbsp of sunflower oil and boiled water 
COOKING PROCESS: 
âž–in a cast iron pot heat oil and add onion. Cook on a high heat until your onion turns golden 
âž–add chicken cubes, cook them stirring occasionally 
âž– when chicken is half way cooked, reduce heat, add carrots and some water if needed. Cook for 5-10 min 
âž– add barberry, salt, turmeric, black pepper, saffron and chilli. Add some water for gravy and cook on low heat for another 10 min. 
ENJOY!
