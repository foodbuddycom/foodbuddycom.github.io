        <p>One of us ran 24 km today 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 another one did nothing and came home very late 🙈😳 hence deserve nothing but celery-tomato salad for dinner 😁 if you are looking for a healthy snack to avoid a late dinner - celery🌱 with tomatoes🍅 can be a really good option, as they contain only 16 and 18 calories respectively, and more important, contain lots of fiber, vitamin A and C and other extremely useful elements that prevent serious deceases such as cancer and diabetes. Stay healthy! P.S. celery does not smell or taste horrible 😜 it's freaking awesome! 🌱💚</p>
