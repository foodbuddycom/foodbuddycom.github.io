        <p>Borscht - seems to be too complex to cook but actually not really. Well, depends on what recipe you follow and whether you like to chop many veggies 🍅🥔🥕🥫😄. My version may not be the authentic one but definitely delicious and one of the healthiest that is part of our athlete diet: make a chicken broth (1/2 chicken), while cooking broth, chop 4 medium sized potatoes (put in water, set aside, otherwise they will be dark), chop: 1 big onion, 2 medium bell peppers (red and yellow), 1 medium beetroot, 2 big garlic cloves, grate 1 big carrot, thinly slice 1/2 cabbage head. Once chicken is cooked, take it out from the broth and set aside to cool down, add potatoes to boiling broth, in parallel stew all other veggies in a deep pan excluding cabbage. Add tomato sauce (used organic tomato-basil sauce) to the stew, a bit of water, let it simmer for 5-10 min, then add the stew to the broth with potatoes, cook for 2-3 min, add cabbage, cook for another 5 min, add salt, pepper to your taste, cut chicken into small pieces and add to borscht. Switch off the stove and let your borscht stay for a while. The longer it stays the more delicious it will be (you will be surprised but it actually tastes best on the next day 😄) eat with sour-cream (we eat it with low fat yogurt) and bread - homemade one if you can (we made bread from buckwheat and white flour - was very delicious 😋👌🏼)
