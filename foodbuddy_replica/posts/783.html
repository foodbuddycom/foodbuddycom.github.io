        <p>Baked salmon, potato wedges, bell pepper and shallots with herbs and spices 😋 such simple and easily accessible vegetable as potato is a great source of complex carbs and very good for a hard or long workout 💪🏼. It's also rich in protein, fiber, and vitamins when it's properly cooked (not fried🍟)</p>
