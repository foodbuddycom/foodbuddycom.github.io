        <p>It’s a monsoon season in Singapore 🌧⚡️🌧, well, the beginning of it. We still have lots of sun in the first half of the day, but in the afternoon the sky is falling ⛈⛈⛈
So we make our own sun ☀️ and it’s yummy in our tummies 😋 
Homemade hummus is very easy to make and perfect dip for friends and family gatherings 👌🏼 check out recipe in the post that we shared on Halloween 👻
