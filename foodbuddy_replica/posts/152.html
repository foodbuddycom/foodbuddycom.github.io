        <p>In our childhood Sunday morning associated with the smell of pancakes ☺️ we wouldn’t get out of bed until we feel it 😄 
This one is probably one of the best breakfast ideas that you should save - BANANA OATMEAL PANCAKES 🥞 🍌 - it’ll take you 5 min to prep the mix and another 15-20 min to bake the pancakes 🥞 (depending on how many skillets you can use simultaneously) 😉 so here you go: 
INGREDIENTS - 1/2 cup of almond milk - 1 ripe banana - 1.5 cup of rolled oats - 2 eggs - 1 egg white - 2 tsp of baking powder
- 1/2 tsp of salt - 1 tbsp of maple syrup (I used brown sugar since I didn’t have maple syrup 🤷🏻‍♀️) - 1 tsp vanilla extract (optional) - Low fat yogurt and fruits and berries to top up your pancakes (or any other topping of your choice) 
METHOD
1️⃣ mix all ingredients (except low fat yogurt and berries) together in a blender 
2️⃣ heat skillet over medium heat, spray the skillet with coconut oil or butter or cooking spray. Pour pancake batter into skillet in nice round circle and bake for ~2 min on one side
3️⃣ top up your pancakes with yogurt, fruits and berries and enjoy 😉
