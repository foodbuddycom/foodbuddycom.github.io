        <p>We are not as active as we wish we would on our Instagram. It’s a busy time at work and home for both of us and lots of sleepless nights (2020, you are so “special” 🤪) and we are sure most of you are going through the same, so we are in it together 🤝 
With so many changes, adjustments, lack of time and increased level of stress, one thing that is non-negotiable for us is our healthy balanced nutrition. This is what keeps us going. It doesn’t have to be complicate, in fact, the healthiest food is the easiest to cook: bake, boil, blanch and in 20 min you can have this wonderful plate with baked sea bass, boiled quinoa porridge and blanched broccoli! 
No matter what you are going though, take care of your nutrition. Make sure it’s healthy and regular. During your week, eat more veggies than fruits, more fruits than nuts and seeds, more nuts and seeds than lean meat, more lean meat than whole grains, more whole grains than dairy products 👍🏼 and don’t forget to treat yourself to your favourite dessert 🧁 at the end of the week 😉
