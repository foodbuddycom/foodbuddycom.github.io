        <p>One of us is lucky to have a healthy and delicious food stall at work, another one stops by once in a while for lunch to stay healthy and fit 💪🏼😜 quinoa-broccoli and barley-pomegranate salads, roasted pumpkin soup, clam chowder and falafel-humus pitta - could we ask for better? 😊😊 what did you guys have for a lunch today?</p>
