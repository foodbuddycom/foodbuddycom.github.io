I dreamed of this but wasn't sure it would happen. I worked very hard to prepare for this race and specifically to be very strong and resilient on the run. It paid off! I was told after the race that it reached 42c "real feel" - what?!? How did I run a marathon in that?? Also, I was 6th overall! Thank you to @athletefood for coaching me and @heppo160 for pushing me so hard on the bike in training and to both of them for having a 27 pound baby to push up a mountain for my runs!  So much more to say but thank you all for following this journey. I fought back tears coming into the stadium thinking about all the s@*! that has brought me down and how I never stopped fighting. 👊👊 #yay #ironmantaiwan #champ #hotAF #sohot</p>
