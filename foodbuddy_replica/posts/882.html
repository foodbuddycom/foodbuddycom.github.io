        <p>Just 30 min in the oven and great healthy dinner will be ready 👌🏼baked salmon is one of the most heart-healthy dishes ❤️because of its high content of Omega-3 fatty acids which human body can't produce and need to intake from food. Omega-3 reduces risk of heart disease such as deadly hearth arrhythmia by improving heart muscle function. Atlantic salmon has the highest content of Omega-3 (2 g per 60 g/2 oz of salmon). Sometimes we avoid eating salmon thinking that it's too fatty meal, however the protein in salmon helps the body maintain metabolism at levels to promote weight loss at the same time feel full longer. @foodbuddy.io is excited about upcoming trip to Japan 🇯🇵 Not only because we are meeting with our Instagram friends from Japan but also because we will have a chance to enjoy absolutely delicious and fresh fish there, including salmon 😋 we are looking forward to meeting all of our Instagram friends in Tokyo on 22 Oct, at 2 pm, in 3-47-8 Sasazuka, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo-to 151-0073 🙏🏼</p>
