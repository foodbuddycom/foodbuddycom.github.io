        <p>You probably already know how much I LOVE prawns because of their taste and health benefit (complete source of protein, not that bad for cholesterol level as people think) 😍🍤💪🏼 if you are looking for some prawn meal - try this colourful prawn salad with beans, celery, chickpeas, corn, bell pepper, and long beans - is a great recovery meal after a workout! 🏋🏼👍🏼</p>
