        <p>When my scales tell me: "dude, you don't deserve a dinner 😱😖🤐" - this wonderful dish - blanched Bok Choy, aka Chinese cabbage, with garlic, mix of oyster and soya sauces and a dash of oil saves me from my hunger. Strongly recommend! 👌🏼 Chinese cabbage can be substituted with Swiss chard or collard greens. Blanch leaves in hot water for 2-3 min (should be still crunchy), mix 2-3 chopped cloves of garlic with a tsp of oyster sauce, 1 tbsp of soya sauce, tsp of oil (I use sunflower) and 2 tbsp of water. Pour sauce on top of leaves and enjoy! 🌱😉🌱</p>
