        <p>It was hot ðŸ”¥ðŸ¥µðŸ˜‚ if you watched @hotones show you know exactly what weâ€™ve been through. Well, living for a decade in Asia made us absolutely immune to the first 4 sauces, but the last 3 made us sweat and dance around the table ðŸ˜‚ especially Daâ€™Bomb, which has Scoville rating of 135600 (not  119700 as we initially thought)ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Hellfire is definitely a hot nightmare we wonâ€™t forget but not as delicious as Daâ€™Bomb!!! Do you like spicy food?
