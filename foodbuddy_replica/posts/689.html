        <p>Yesterday's wine with friends was good but this "wine" is much better 😉 my Saturday brunch - very nutritious, here's almost everything you could imagine (or all I had in my fridge 😬): oats, low fat yogurt, blend of: blueberries, strawberries, grapes, pineapple, chia, almonds, walnuts. High quality food with almost half of daily limit of calories, carbs and protein (nutrition value is per 1 serving). I always knew it's good to have big wine glasses 😁 -------
