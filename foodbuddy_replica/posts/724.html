        <p>Hearty beef soba noodle soup. Fueling for Audax 400 km 😁💪🏼🚴🏼🤔😰 lean beef broth - much better for weight control compared to cream-soups. Also contains good amount of potassium (good for your muscles strength and body balance) and niacin (good for your heart). However has high sodium content (causes irritation, joint pain, swelling, etc) so better not to eat it too often. Good substitute can be chicken broth 👍🏻#triathlon #ironmantri #healthyfood  #sportnutrition #running #swimbikerun #marathon #dietfood #cervelo #orbea #specializedbikes #giantbikes #canyonbikes #bmcbikes #boardmanbikes #trailrunning #ironmantraining #marathontraining #audax400</p>
