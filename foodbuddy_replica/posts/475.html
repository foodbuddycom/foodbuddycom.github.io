        <p>Experimented with whatever I had in my fridge and cupboards and it worked! Made an awesome soup that didn’t take much time🍲👍🏼 here’s recipe: stir fry chopped leek, carrot, mushrooms in a small amount of olive oil and sesame oil in the soup pot, add hot water, soya sauce, soba noodles and dry seaweed - cook until soba is cooked (5-7 min) easy, healthy and delicious 😋
