        <p>A post workout dinner: steamed chicken breast with herbs, red lentils and spinach-pepper-cherry tomatoes salad. Reloaded with proteins, carbs and iron 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 took only 20 min to cook 🤗 such meal can be great as a pre-workout meal as well but should be consumed at least couple of hours before training 🚴🏼🏃🏼🏊🏼⛹🏽🏋🏼🏄🏽</p>
