        <p>For a very long time pomelo was an alien fruit on supermarket shelves for me 👽 when I first tried it, I asked myself why the heck did I buy it?!😱 So huge, so hard to peel and with extremely bitter intersections 😖 but when I tasted the fruit I understood that it was worth all my time and effort! 
Pomelo turned out to be a great fruit for athletes 💪🏼👍🏼 A serving of pomelo, consisting of about 190 grams, contains 193% of one’s vitamin C daily requirement, 12% of one’s daily potassium needs, and 8% of one’s recommended fiber intake. Pomelo also has a very high water content which is essential for proper hydration💦💦💦 Try out Ottolenghi's pomelo-mango salad with mint, cilantro  and watercress leaves, sesame seeds and peanuts 👌🏼 marinade pomelo in white rice vinegar with cinnamon stick, star anis, ginger and red chilli for not less then 30 min. Then remove cinnamon stick and star anis, add mango and greens, sesame and peanuts, pinch of salt and 2 tbs of peanut oil. Enjoy 😋</p>
