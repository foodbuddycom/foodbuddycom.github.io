        <p>#Singlish 101 here. Thanks to @ostroynyc, my cycling group "Dabber Mash" is now branded with custom jerseys with a bunch of Singaporean, mostly Hokkien dialect based sayings. Most of them made in to Oxford English Dictionary officially, by the way! Brief overview what we got..."CHOPE KING" for "Choping", — ridiculous and counter-productive blocking of usage of free tables at food-courts by putting one's umbrellas, security badges, wallets, iPhone X-es, so that no one takes your place while you queue for 4$ bowl of noodles. "KIASU" - a person "governed by self-interest, typically manifesting as a selfish, grasping attitude arising from a fear of missing out on something. "WAH LAO" — or actually "WAH LAO EH" — something like "Oh my Father!.." — catching someone by surprise. "LIDDAT" — Singlish for "Like that", usually used when someone disappoints one, and one says 'Why like that, huh?..'. "ANG MOH" — actually a belittling word for a white caucasian. In my case, I only accept this when I facilitate this myself. If anyone else calls me 'Ang Moh', I put the opponent back in to canvas quite quickly.
Life in Singapore is great, culturally unique, with 4 official national languages, intersection of transient short-term contractually-landed professionals and long-term deep traditions. 
What do you guys know about Singapore culture?
