        <p>HOT & SOUR MUSHROOM SOUP - another delicious masterpiece from @ottolenghi ‘s Plenty More. 

Ingredients of this soup are mind blowing: Lemongrass, lime leaves, star anise, tamari sauce and tamarind paste, prunes, celery, cilantro, basil, ginger, chilli, bean sprouts, green beans, onion, garlic, carrots, and of course plenty of different mushrooms - enoki, white, buna-shimeji mushrooms 😃 

We are sure you’ve already guessed how many valuable nutrients this soup has, but if we focus just on one - MUSHROOMS - in our opinion they should be in the diet of all endurance sportsmen as they have great nutrition profile. Mushrooms are packed with minerals, vitamins, protein, antioxidants and low in calories 💪🏼 they can help you to deal with inflammation, support your immune system, help you deal with stress to name a few of benefits. Mushrooms are also very versatile - can be added to many dishes: salads, soups, main dishes, wraps, pizzas (list can go on) 😋 
Won’t be sharing the recipe in this post as it’s quite lengthy (will share link in stories) - check it out.
