        <p>Ultra running has been my passion for many years 🏃🏾‍♂️. And I have tried various types of supplements to aid in my training and recovery. But nothing comes close to the supplements from @fitlinefirst. Especially two of their supplements that I take:
1️⃣ Activize - enhances the transport of oxygen to the cells in order to generate energy. I take this prior to my training. And it aids in me being able to push harder during my VO2 max, Tempo, and Steady State Runs. 
2️⃣ Munogen - this helps with nitric oxide formation in my body that boost red blood cell formation. I take prior to my training as well. 

And a bit more about my training routine: 

For many years I have been training on my own.  Soon I realised that I was hitting a plateau. So, last year I decided to get a coach to break the plateau so as to allow me to propel faster and longer. 
My typical training season is about 3 months:
➖First month comprises of VO2 max training with the weekends being a combination of VO2 max and endurance run efforts
➖Second month comprises of tempo and weekends are a combination of tempo and endurance efforts.
➖Third month comprises of Steady State efforts and long back to back sessions.
Training efforts are based on Relative Perceived Effort (RPE) with 1 being very easy to 10 being very hard.
Each training month trains me on various RPEs with the goal of improving my endurance efforts.
So my typical week, if I am on 3rd month will look something like this:
➖Mon - rest
➖Tue - 2hrs Run (2 x 30mins SS run RPE 6-7, 40mins Endurance RPE 5-6)
➖Wed - 1hr run (Endurance RPE 5-6)
➖Thur - same as Tue
➖Fri - rest
➖Sat and Sun - long back to back sessions.
Let me know if you have any questions 😁</p>
