        <p>Funny, as much as I hated oatmeal porridge when I was a kid, I love it now! I know, habits change but the oatmeal porridge in daycare was simply disgusting (at least I remember it so 😄) I, used to hid it in the table pocket spoon by spoon 😂 so I could declare that “I’M DONE” and escape from “torture room” 😁 if only it was with fruits, nuts and seeds and honey! I’m sure I would eat my and other kids’ portions 😂 —
