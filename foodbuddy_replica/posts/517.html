        <p>It’s Friday people!😁 started the best day of the week with the juiciest and one of the healthiest breakfasts - fruits& berries bowl with chia seeds and low fat yogurt! I LOVE fruits (well, who doesn’t 😄) their combination varies in my breakfast but blueberries are constant (luckily they are available throughout the year in Singapore). Crunchy, juice sweet and sometimes sour blueberries are great source of antioxidants, vitamin C and carbs - one of the best berries for athletes.
