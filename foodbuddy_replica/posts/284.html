        <p>Good morning everyone from sunny Singapore 🌴☀️🇸🇬 Recently you pointed in one of our posts that dairy products shouldn’t be eaten with foods rich in antioxidants. Indeed, milk protein casein binds with antioxidants, reducing their ability to fight harmful free radicals. To what extent?Multiple studies and researches were done to find out the effect of diary products on antioxidants, however their results are conflicting. Bottom line is that dairy products may reduce effect of antioxidants but not 100%.There is currently no evidence that consuming dairy with antioxidant-rich foods reduces their overall health benefits. We also need to keep in mind that many other factors affecting the antioxidant capacity (and even the nutrient content) of different foods. On this note I’m going to enjoy my favourite breakfast - fruit salad with seeds and low fat yogurt 😋 but we would be curious to know what do you guys think about mixing yogurt with antioxidants rich food? What substitutes do you use? —
