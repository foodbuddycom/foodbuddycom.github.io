        <p>Our hearts are broken with the tragedy that’s happening in Australia 🔥💔🔥! While the scope of help that is urgently required for people and wildlife affected by bushfires is huge, we want to raise your attention to and ask for your help with fundraising that was organised by @anna.heusler 
GoFundMe link in Anna’s bio and here: https://bit.ly/2FsA6Aa and repost from @anna.heusler page: Meeting this little guy who I’ve named “Kodak” has changed my life. I’ve started volunteith Adelaide Koala Rescue and I’ve been personally involved in the rescue of 3 koalas. 🐨 Kodak has helped bring worldwide media attention to the devastating of the bushfires and the threat to our wildlife. 🦘I’ve also started  a Go Fund Me campaign which has reached over $15K in 3 days and is still growing thanks to the generosity of folks from around the 🌍 for which I offer a massive THANK YOU 🙏🙏🙏

Please see my “Go Fund Me” page which is on my Instagram profile bio @bikebug2019 where I have commenced raising money for the rescue team caring for over 100 sick and injured koalas in Adelaide.
