        <p>My “sinful” carbs 😉 Looking for a good source of carbs, light and super fast dinner - here’s extremely easy one - boiled buckwheat with veggie salad (it takes ~7-10 min to cook buckwheat, in the meanwhile cut whatever vegetables you have at home. My salad is made of 🍅, 🥒, peppers, radish, coriander, dill, cashew nuts, just a bit of sunflower seeds and olive oil, salt and black pepper) - simple, healthy and delicious 🤤 most of the time eating healthy requires less time than taking a nice picture of that healthy food, agree 😉?
