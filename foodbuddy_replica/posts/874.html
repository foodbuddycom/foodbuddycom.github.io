        <p>Hello from sunny ☀️ fruity 🍇🍈🍊juicy Singapore 😉 the "polka dot" fruition the plate is a dragon fruit 🐉 😄 (its peel looks like a dragon skin) it has light taste and very refreshing AND it's one of the best "super fruits": contains good amount of monounsaturated fats - good for heart health ❤️, rich in fiber- supports digestive system, rich in protein - helps muscle repair 💪🏼 its content of active antioxidants, that your body needs for fighting with free radicals,  is as good as acai berry's, dragon fruit has a positive effect on arthritis 👊🏼 those who haven't tried it - don't be scared of a dragon/cactus-like fruit on the shelves of your grocery store 😜</p>
