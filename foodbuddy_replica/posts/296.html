#SCSM2018 runners, this is a great chance for you to try the official sport nutrition of Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon as #SHOTZ nutrition will be on 3 aid stations for full distance & 1 aid station for half-marathon.
We tested Shotz and strongly recommend both products for their quality: ✅ Gels are very liquid and so pleasant to DRINK! You can actually sip it as a glass of wine 🍷 and this is the right thing to do during the run if you want to avoid an adverse effect from your energy gel ☝🏼
✅ Electrolyte tablets dissolve in water extremely fast and have very refreshing taste and nice aftertaste compared to the tablets that we used to take. This is because SHOTZ electrolyte tablets don't have any sugar at all! They are also higher in sodium and riboflavin 👍🏼Electrolytes tablets are essential for long workouts and races in such hot and humid place as Singapore as our bodies lose a lot of electrolytes with sweat. One valuable tip for you: take energy gels and dissolved electrolyte tablet sequentially, at least 15 min apart. Do not wash down your gel with the sport drink. Research proves that “solutions with carb concentrations above 12 percent are not absorbed or tolerated as well”. —
