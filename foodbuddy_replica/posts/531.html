        <p>Didn't realize that I missed plain oatmeal porridge with fruits and berries so much ☺️ it's a figs season right now which makes me even happier 😋 yummy, ripe figs are available in stores in abundance! One more reason to love this breakfast is because it is a great source of dietary fiber (both oats and fig are rich in fiber) - kept me full till very late lunch today. Figs are also rich in potassium ☝🏼dear athletes - add them to your regular 🍌 while they are available fresh 😉
