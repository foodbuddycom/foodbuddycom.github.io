        <p>We have a great weekend when it starts late and with pancakes for breakfast 🥞😋and it’s a fantastic one when it is a long weekend, like this one 😁
What is a great weekend for you? 
Hope you enjoy yours as we ours 🤗

If you need a recipe: ➖ 2 cups bread / plain flour ➖ 1.5 tbsp brown sugar
➖ 4 tsp baking powder
➖ 1/4 tsp baking soda (mix it with water before you add it to your batter)
➖4 tbsp of melted butter
➖1 large egg
➖1/2 tsp salt
➖1.5 cups of warm milk (and a bit extra to add in case your batter is too thick)
➖2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
Mix well all ingredients into batter that is thick but you still can pour it to a heated skillet, lightly greased with butter. When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip your pancake and cook until golden. Keep going until your batter is finished 😉
